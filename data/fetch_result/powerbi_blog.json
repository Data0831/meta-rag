        "content": "## Celebrating 10 years of Power BI  \nJuly 2025 marked Power BI’s 10-year anniversary, a milestone celebrated with the community through special events, contests, and learning opportunities. When Power BI was launched a decade ago, it had about 500,000 early adopters: today it’s used by over 375,000 organizations worldwide. In fact, 30 million monthly active users now rely on Power BI for insights—a testament to how the community of users have transformed business intelligence at scale and how far the platform has come as creators now leverage the full power of Microsoft Fabric empowering users with a unified experience for data and AI driven innovation.  \nTo celebrate this achievement, Power BI rolled out the [“#PBI10” anniversary events](https://aka.ms/pbi10). A two-month learning bonanza ([live expert-led skill sessions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mRdX0jYoHJk), dashboard design workshops, and AMA Q&As), discounted certification exam vouchers, and even a fun retrospective startup experience in Power BI Desktop that paid homage to the product’s evolution. The festivities culminated in a [virtual birthday party](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nbpEawj9I_Q), featuring the Power BI team, who shared behind-the-scenes stories, highlighted the platform’s journey, and gave a sneak peek of the future in an interactive live stream. Throughout the celebration, longtime users and newcomers alike were invited to share their own Power BI stories and creative dashboards on social media using #PBI10, bringing to life a decade of impactful data culture.",

        "content": "## Write Back Within Reports  \nThe introduction of translytical task flows (Preview) in Power BI allows users to trigger actions and write data back to source systems directly from a report, turning insights into action without leaving the experience. “Translytical” reflects the blending of transactional and analytical work; in practice, it means Power BI can now support write‑back and operational workflows that historically required separate applications. When a metric signals that something needs attention, the user can follow up immediately—modifying a record, adding context, or kicking off a custom workflow–without switching tools or breaking focus.  \nThis evolution is powered by [Fabric user data functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-engineering/user-data-functions/user-data-functions-overview), which enable reports to initiate actions that once lived entirely outside the business intelligence layer. It represents a shift toward more interactive, closed‑loop decision‑making, where a report becomes not just a place to observe what’s happening but a space where work can continue. At FabCon Vienna 2025, [Patrick LeBlanc illustrated this direction](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IryMPbSsv10&t=3313s) through a custom AI integration that generated text summaries based on user inputs using translytical task flows, demonstrating how these capabilities can support richer and more responsive report experiences.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/12/word-image-31939-4-2.png)",

This full‑screen chat interface lets users ask questions about their data in natural language queries like “What were this quarter’s sales by region?” to receive instant answers drawn from the reports, datasets, and apps they already have access to, all while honoring existing security permissions. Copilot identifies the most relevant sources, returns a clear response, and includes references back to the visuals or models that informed its response, helping users understand exactly where each insight came from.  \nThroughout the year, Copilot became even more accessible with the preview of [Copilot in Power BI Mobile](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/power-bi-november-2025-feature-summary/#post-31766-_Toc214035073), bringing natural‑language data exploration to phones through voice or text. Improvements across the experience made answers more reliable and contextual, supported by clearer guidance and features like [verified answers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-prepare-data-ai-verified-answers), which ensured certain responses came from vetted, authoritative definitions. These updates reflect a broader move toward conversational BI, where anyone can explore data simply by asking. As organizations lean further into AI‑assisted decision‑making, Chat with your data lowers the barrier to engaging with Power BI—making insights easier to reach, easier to understand, and closer to the way people naturally think.",

Building on the changes highlighted in our [Preparing of the new Card visual in General Availability](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/prepare-for-new-card-visual/) blog post, these are additional enhancements we’ve delivered:  \n* **Callout image alignment:** Previously, the callout image aligned to the callout label but now the image aligns correctly within the callout area.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-103223.png)  \n* **Background image behavior:** Before, the background image would repeat if they did not fill the container. We’ve updated the image fit and names to align with design principles to prevent images from repeating.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-103451.png)  \n* **Reference label padding:** Outer padding in reference labels unintentionally affected the callout area, pushing elements out of place. We’ve removed the **Outer padding** control and added a **Padding** control to ensure there’s consistent spacing across sections.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-105049.png)  \n* **Autogrid enhancement**: In certain layouts, an empty column would previously appear. With the addition of Autogrid, it intelligently arranges categories and cards without leaving empty columns for improved usability.  \n![Side by side comparison showing the that in certain layouts, the empty space in a multi-category layout no longer appears ](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-13-110317-scaled.png)  \nTry adding the new **Card visual** to your next report and experience the difference for yourself.  \nFor more details and step-by-step instructions, check out the official documentation: [Create a (new) card visual in Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/visuals/power-bi-visualization-new-card)",

Copilot can now automatically select the most relevant data sources, asks clarifying questions when additional context is needed, and provides simpler, text-based search results. With new homepage entry points and suggested prompts, you can start exploring insights more easily than ever. This new experience dramatically reduces time-to-insight by removing manual data source selection and guesswork helping every user get accurate answers faster.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-19.png)  \nWe’re also continuing to invest in our data answering capabilities and improving how users get answers from their data. We’ve made substantial improvements under the hood to how we match user prompts in Copilot to verified answers and the appropriate filters. Verified answers can now interpret and apply filters more accurately, reducing mismatches between what users ask and what’s displayed, better aligning with each user’s prompt.

With tools to retrieve model schema, generate optimized DAX queries using Copilot, and execute queries instantly. Teams can build custom agents that deliver faster, more accurate insights without manual intervention. Built for interoperability, the MCP Server allows these agents to integrate seamlessly and securely across your analytics landscape.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-20-1024x576.png)  \nWe’re also making data modeling simpler, smarter and more collaborative with Power BI Modeling MCP Server (Preview). Built on the open MCP standard, it enables AI agents to securely connect with Power BI and interact with semantic models through natural language, so you can focus on intent rather than syntax. You can describe what you want to build, from tables and relationships to measures and refactors, and let AI handle the details. With support for bulk operations, best practice evaluation, and DAX validation, teams can accelerate model development, reduce errors, and bring greater consistency and agility to every stage of the modeling process.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-17.png)  \nAs your organization’s data models grow in complexity, maintaining accuracy, consistency, and governance becomes increasingly challenging. With Semantic Model Version History, now generally available, you can track, compare, and restore previous versions of your semantic models to protect against errors and enable safe experimentation while maintaining full auditability for compliance and governance. With TMDL Visual Studio Code Extension, also generally available, you can author models as code in Visual Studio Code accelerates builds while bringing modern code development practices to semantic modeling.  \nReady to transform your business intelligence?  \nThe future of business intelligence is here. AI-powered, accessible, and built for trust. Whether you’re a business user who needs instant answers or a data professional building the next generation of analytics solutions, Power BI gives you the tools to turn your data into impact.  \nLooking ahead, you can expect a continued focus on simplifying how people interact with data, empowering everyone – from business users to data professionals – to get answers quickly and confidently.  \nTo dive deeper on these announcements, catch our breakout session [‘Empower Business Users with AI driven insights in Microsoft Fabric](https://ignite.microsoft.com/sessions/BRK223?source=sessions) at Microsoft Ignite on Wednesday November 19th at 4:00 PM PT.

This will open a chat experience where you can type or dictate (IOS only) your question and Copilot will take it from there.  \nWhen you ask about a metric or a KPI, most chances that Copilot will generate a visual for you in addition to answering your question with text. Tap on the visual to open a pane and interact with the generated visual.  \nTap on the citation or reference to learn what content Copilot used for grounding its answer. You can also open the report from there as well.  \nIf you want to share insight discovered in the chat with others, select the ‘Share’ button from the visual pane, or the copy from the chat.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-2.png)  \nThe iOS apps (iPhone and iPad) also support dictation – so you can use voice interaction to ask Copilot questions. Use the mic icon in the chat box and Copilot will start listening, waiting for your questions.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-3.png)  \nWith this new standalone Copilot experience, you can now easily get quick answers and stay on top of things by chatting with your data directly from your mobile.",

Previously, Copilot asked users to choose from a list of possible data sources before answering questions.  \nNow, it handles that step automatically: if it finds a strong match, it selects it in the background and goes straight to the answer. When more context is needed, Copilot will ask simple clarifying questions to find the right source. Although the additional reasoning may require a few more seconds, obtaining an accurate response from a reliable source justifies the brief wait.  \n![A screenshot of a chat  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-screenshot-of-a-chat-ai-generated-content-may-b.png)  \nAdditionally, in response to search questions like ‘Find reports about sales’, you’ll now see a much simpler text-based list of items.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-5-scaled.png)  \n**New entry points right from the home page**  \nBy late November, you’ll be able to access Copilot right on your home page, making it easier than ever to find what you’re looking for or ask ad hoc questions about your data! Simply type your question and hit enter.\n![A screenshot of a computer  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-3.png)\nIf you preferred the old home page, no problem.

The new Report Copilot experience is available now in the Power BI service and Power BI Desktop.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-10.png)  \n**Smarter, More Capable Visual Creation**  \nThe new Copilot understands your data and intent more deeply than ever. Just tell it what you want to create, and watch your ideas come to life instantly.  \n* **Better visual recommendations:** Copilot now selects the most appropriate visuals for your data automatically.\n* **Expanded Visual Library:** Copilot supports a wider range of visuals, giving you more options to present insights into exactly how you envision them.\n* **Improved context awareness:** When you describe what you want to see, Copilot now understands more nuanced instructions, producing more accurate and insightful results.  \nTo learn more about creating and modifying reports with Copilot, refer to the [Create reports in the Power BI service with Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-create-report-service) documentation.",

        "content": "### Improvements to Verified Answers  \nThis update enhances how verified answers inherit the state of your visual, expands filtering flexibility, and delivers more reliable results.  \n**What’s New?**  \n**Verified answers now inherit and reflect the entire visual state:** Previously, verified answers only captured filter states active at the time of creation. With this update, they now inherit the entire visual state, including slicers. This change directly addresses one of the most common pieces of feedback we received.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-11.png)  \nReport slicers impacting the visual are being inherited and shown in the verified answer.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-12.png)  \nIn addition to slicers, we will support additional visual states:  \n* **Slicer selections**\n* **Field parameter choices**\n* **Cross filters and cross highlights**\n* **Drill-through filters**  \n**Expanded Filtering Capabilities for Authors:** There is now more flexibility when configuring verified answers. The limit for predefined filter permutations has increased from 3 to 10, enabling more complex and nuanced configurations.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-13.png)  \nFrom a consumption perspective, we see that most prompt requests naturally use between one and three filters.  \n* ‘Show total sales for the region 1 in Q1’.\n* ‘What is the usage of Product 1 in Country 1 during Month 1’.\n* ‘Show average satisfaction scores by City 1 and segment 1’.  \nStill, some business questions require deeper combinations of filters, and this expanded limit ensures verified answers can handle even the most detailed reporting scenarios.  \n**Improved Filtering Reliability:** What are more filters, if they aren’t applied consistently? We’ve made substantial improvements under the hood to how we match user prompts in Copilot to verified answers and the appropriate filters. Verified Answers now interpret and apply filters more accurately, reducing mismatches between what users ask and what’s displayed, and ensuring filters are included when they should be.  \n**New card visual support:** We have enabled the highly requested new card visual that you can now set as verified answers, the new card visual and Azure maps will be supported in Verified Answers creation and consumption.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-14.png)  \n**Why it Matters:** These updates make verified answers feel native to your Copilot consumption experiences, seamlessly adapting to slicers, filters, interactions, and drill-through actions that users have come to expect from their visuals. Consumers will get answers that truly reflect the context of their analysis.  \nThe result, faster, more accurate insights, and a smoother path from question to confidence, and better grounding for the rest of your Copilot experience to learn from.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-15.png)  \nFor more info on how these updates work, refer to the [Prepare Your Data for AI – Verified Answers](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-prepare-data-ai-verified-answers)  documentation.",

This means you’ll be able to create powerful, custom agents on top of data that lives in your semantic models.  \nThe server has three tools that give your agents the ability to reason over your data, and respond to a user’s prompts:  \n* **Get Semantic Model Schema:** This tool provides the agent with the structure of the semantic model.\n* **Generate Query:** This tool uses Copilot in Power BI to generate a DAX query based on the user’s input and best practices. The agent can then iterate on this query if it chooses or simply proceeds with the provided query.\n* **Execute Query:** This tool gives the agent a powerful mechanism to query the semantic model to respond to any question a user asks.  \nThese tools can be implemented by any application that hosts an MCP client, such as Visual Studio Code. Other, non-Microsoft MCP clients can be supported with Service Principal authentication, backed by Azure Entra ID.  \n![A screenshot of a computer  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-6.png)  \nThe remote MCP Server for Power BI enables you to easily build the next generation of agents on top of the data your organization has already invested so heavily in.

This month, we are enabling the same option on the matrix visual. As a reminder: with the Grow to fit option, any extra space in the visual is evenly distributed across existing columns when the total column width is smaller than the visual container, which eliminates the need to do manual resizing to fill the gaps.  \nIf your matrix isn’t using the full visual width, you can manually resize columns or use the new ‘Grow to fit’ option. For example, this matrix doesn’t fully utilize the available space:  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/word-image-31766-17.png)  \nNavigate to the format pane under Column headers > Options, toggle Auto-size width to ‘On’, and set ‘Resize behavior’ to ‘Grow to fit’.

        "content": "## General  \n### Announcing deprecation of R and Python visuals in Embed for your customers solution  \nWe are announcing an important change for Power BI customers who use Embed for your customers with R or Python visuals. As part of our ongoing commitment to provide a secure, scalable, and robust analytics platform, we continually evaluate our feature set to ensure alignment with industry standards, customer needs, and platform performance.  \n**What’s Changing?**  \nStarting May 2026, Power BI will end support for the ability to embed reports and dashboards containing R or Python visuals using Power BI’s [Embed for your customers](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-analytics-power-bi#embed-for-your-customers) solution (also known as app owns data) and Publish to web scenarios. Embed for your customers typically involves a custom app which manages authentication directly, and for which app users do not need Power BI licenses.  \nThis change does not impact customers leveraging [secure embeddings](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-analytics-power-bi#secure-embed) to SharePoint, Website or Portal. [Embed for your organization](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/embedded/embedded-analytics-power-bi#embed-for-your-organization) (also known as user owns data) scenarios are also not impacted.  \n**Timeline for Deprecation**  \n* **Announcement & Guidance:** Effective immediately, customers are notified of the upcoming deprecation.\n* **Deprecation Date:** Official support for embedding R and Python visuals in PaaS scenarios will end on 05/01/2026.\n* **Post-Deprecation:** After this date, any embedded Power BI reports or dashboards containing R or Python visuals will still load, but the R or Python charts will display as blank. Reports without these visuals will continue to function as expected.  \n**Recommended Actions for Customers**  \n* Review all embedded Power BI reports and dashboards to identify usage of R or Python visuals.\n* Plan to update or redesign any affected reports using alternative Power BI visuals or DAX-based analytics. Consider leveraging Fabric Notebooks for more sophisticated or technical visualizations.\n* Consult the Power BI & Fabric documentation for guidance on using alternative visuals effectively.  \n**Support and Resources**  \nWe understand that this change may require updates to your existing solutions. Please reach out via the Power BI community forums or through your Microsoft account representative for personalized guidance.",

Until then, users must continue to manually enable the PBIR preview feature.\n* **The PBIX file format is not going away:**The PBIR format is included within the PBIX, so users who continue working with PBIX files willnot experience any changes to their experience.\n* **PBIR supportability:**PBIR will remain in*Preview*and Default to PBIR serves as the final stage before General Availability ([planned for Q3 2026](https://roadmap.fabric.microsoft.com/?product=powerbi)). Any issues identified during this period will be prioritized and addressed by our support team.  \nThe **Power BI Enhanced Report Format (PBIR)** represents a major leap forward – empowering developers and teams to integrate source control, CI/CD, and collaborative development while enabling AI agents and scripts to programmatically create, edit, and manage Power BI reports in a fully supported way. Refer to the [PBIR documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-report?tabs=desktop#pbir-format) to learn more.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-10-1024x578.png)  \nSince its initial release, conversion to PBIR has been optional and available only through Power BI Desktop. ~~Beginning January 2026, all new reports created in both Power BI Service and Desktop will use the PBIR format by default, and existing reports will be automatically converted to PBIR when edited and saved~~. Beginning in January 2026, all new reports created in the Power BI service will use the PBIR format by default, with the rollout starting in January and completing by the end of February. Existing service reports will be automatically converted to PBIR when edited and saved. Power BI Desktop will begin using PBIR as the default format with the March 2026 release.  \nIf you prefer to keep using the PBIR-Legacy report format during the preview, you can opt out.  \n* **In Power BI Desktop**, disable the [Preview Features](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-report#enable-the-pbir-format-preview-feature).\n+ Store reports using enhanced metadata format (PBIR) and Store PBIX reports using enhanced metadata format (PBIR).\n* **In Service**, disable the new [Admin Tenant Setting](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-report#pbir-in-service).\n+ Automatically convert and store reports in the Power BI enhanced metadata format (PBIR). The tenant setting is available now but won’t take effect until January 2026.  \n**When PBIR reaches General Availability (GA),** it will become the only supported report format. All reports will automatically convert to the PBIR format, and PBIR-Legacy will no longer be supported. We recommend preparing for this migration ahead of GA.  \nDefaulting to PBIR is an important milestone for General Availability of the broader [Power BI Project (PBIP)](https://aka.ms/pbidesktopdevmode) file format. PBIP is built around a key principle: providing code-friendly file formats, something not possible with PBIR-Legacy. General Availability for PBIP is planned for 2026.",

Now it’s just that the AI is asking the ad-hoc data question on behalf of the user. Natural language data questions are answered more consistently and easily when the AI can rely on business logic encapsulated by semantic models. LLMs are already familiar with well-defined API surface areas for metadata and queries enabling agentic modeling and consumption. Power BI semantic models are already deployed at scale across countless large organizations and primed to accelerate AI-driven consumption of enterprise data.",

With this tool, users can efficiently perform operations across all add-ins, ensuring consistency and saving valuable time.  \nTo get this add-in go to ‘Add-ins’ in PowerPoint ribbon and search for ‘Microsoft Power BI Controller’. Select ‘Add’ to add-in to your ribbon. Once you select it, a new panel will open with the commands that the Power BI Controller supports in this preview release (change view modes from snapshot/public snapshot to live and vice versa, and sync with Power BI. More commands will be added soon.)  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/10/controller_blog-1.gif)  \nWhen you apply a command on the entire presentation, only the add-ins that can honor the command will execute it. Other add-ins might reject it and will report back to the controller as not applicable. For example, if you send a ‘Switch to snapshot’ command and there are add-ins in the presentation that are already in snapshot mode they will not re-take the snapshot but will report to the controller that this command is not applicable for them. Other add-ins, which are in live mode, will respect the command and will switch to snapshot mode.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/10/status-1024x576.png)",

Such solutions require extensive API surface area for enterprise management scenarios. For example, you can use the [Fabric item CRUD APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/articles/item-management/item-management-overview) to list semantic models, create and update them, and copy them to other workspaces. You can also use the Power BI REST APIs to perform [advanced refresh operations](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/datasets/refresh-dataset-in-group) and [execute DAX queries](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/datasets/execute-queries-in-group), among other things. For semantic model metadata operations and refreshes, you can also leverage XMLA endpoints and the Tabular Object Model (TOM) through [Analysis Services client libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/analysis-services/client-libraries?view=sql-analysis-services-2025).  \nWe are releasing a new Fabric REST API for configuring connection bindings for semantic models. A connection binding defines what data connection a semantic model will use to connect to an underlying data source. In scenarios where data sources change—such as moving from development to production environments, migrating infrastructure, or switching connection details—being able to programmatically update these bindings is crucial. The new [Bind Semantic Model Connection REST API](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2329807) marks a significant improvement for BI pros and developers to automate these tasks.",

It returns one or multiple item connections, which correspond to the data sources the semantic model uses. |\n| Step 2 | List all connections you can access | Use the [List Connections](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/core/connections/list-connections) REST API. It returns the connection details for all the connections you have access to. |\n| Step 3 | Pick the data connection you want to use for the semantic model binding | Find the connection in the list connection response of Step 2 that matches the connection details of the item connection of Step 1. Take note of the connection id because you most likely will need it in subsequent steps.  If there is no matching connection, you can create one by using the [Create Connection](https://review.learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/fabric/core/connections/create-connection) REST API. |\n| Step 4 | Generate the payload for the Bind Semantic Model Connection request | Create a JSON document with the connection bindingdetails, which typically include the connectivityType, the connectionDetails, and the object id of the connection you want to bind.  Note that the connection id is not applicable if you want to use default connection settings (“connectivityType”: “Automatic”) or if you want to unbind a data source (“connectivityType”: “None”). |\n| Step 5 | Submit the JSON payload in a POST request to the [Bind Semantic Model Connection](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2329807) REST API | You must submit a request for each data source individually. To bind multiple data source references of a semantic model, you must submit multiple bind connection requests. |",

        "content": "## General  \n### Bing Map deprecation plan & Update in Power BI  \nTo ensure a seamless experience and stay ahead of upcoming Microsoft’s plan to retire Bing Maps for Enterprise, Power BI is proactively transitioning from Bing Maps to Azure Maps. By making this change early, Power BI users will benefit from enhanced mapping capabilities and long-term support. We encourage customers to begin updating their reports to Azure Maps visuals to stay future ready.  \n**Power BI Desktop and Web (Edit- mode)**  \nEarlier, we shared plans to remove the Bing Maps icon from the Visualization pane. After reconsideration, we’ve decided to keep the icon visible for now to ensure continuity and minimize disruption.  \nPlease note that the Bing Maps visual is still slated for deprecation, and we’re currently discussing the timeline. Any existing Bing Maps already in your reports will still be available.  \nIn preparation for the upcoming change, upgrade to Azure Maps unless:  \n* You have team members who would consume the report in China, Korea, or government clouds.\n* You’re physically located in China or Korea (regardless of where your home tenant is located).\n* You’re part of a government cloud.  \nWe’re working to support Azure Maps in these unsupported regions. If you and all report users are in a supported region, you’re encouraged to start using Azure Maps now.  \nLearn how to [upgrade to Azure Maps](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/power-bi-visual-conversion). To see the list of supported regions, see [Azure Maps service geographic scope](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/geographic-scope). For more information about Azure Maps, see [Get started with Azure Maps Power BI visual](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/azure-maps/power-bi-visual-get-started).  \n**Power BI Report Builder**  \nThe migration of paginated reports map visuals from Bing Maps to Azure Maps has begun. This migration will occur in two phases: first, migrating to Azure Maps in PBIRB, followed by migration to Azure Maps for paginated reports in the service. The initial phase is complete. Beginning with the September release of PBIRB, users can create map visuals powered by Azure Maps by default. However, paginated reports published in the service will continue to use Bing Maps until phase two is completed. Phase two is expected to be completed by mid-November.  \nPaginated reports authors can revert to Bing Maps for authoring in PBIRB until both phases are complete. To enable this, users must set the ‘RevertToBingMaps’ registry key located in the ‘Computer\\HKEY\\_LOCAL\\_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Microsoft Power BI Report Builder’ folder to 1. If the ‘Microsoft Power BI Report Builder’ folder does not exist, it should be manually created before setting the registry key.",

In Power BI Desktop or Power BI web modeling, open the DAX query view and select the Copilot button. Describe the insights you are seeking, and Copilot generates the corresponding DAX query. Conversationally edit the DAX query with Copilot, run it as you go, and keep it when you are ready.  \nThe following screenshot shows Copilot helping to write a DAX query from the prompt ‘How are we tracking towards our targeted deliveries for each month?’ in DAX query view of Power BI Desktop. The DAX query results show by month the number of deliveries made, the target, attainment %, and variance to target.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-31333-1.png)  \nThe next screenshot demonstrates how to write a DAX query to answer the user prompt ‘Can you indicate which month we were over target or under target on deliveries?’ in DAX query view of Power BI web modeling. The DAX query results show by month the number of deliveries made, the target, variance to target, and the status of each month as over or under target.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-31333-2.png)  \nCopilot is grounded in the semantic model, and AI instructions set on the model by Prep for AI. This includes verified answers by understanding the fields used and filters applied. Semantic model tables, columns, descriptions, display folders, hierarchy information, relationships, and measures are all known already to Copilot when creating DAX queries.  \nCopilot to help write DAX queries is used in DAX query view, and in chat with your data experiences when a DAX query is returned as well as data agents when a semantic model is included.  \nTo learn more, refer to the [Write DAX queries with Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/dax-copilot) documentation, and try it out today!",

This means the slicer can interact dynamically with other visuals on your report page by emphasizing relevant values and dimming unrelated ones.  \nFor example: If you select North America in a column chart, the Button Slicer will:  \n* Highlight buttons like Canada and United States (since they belong to North America).\n* Dim all other countries to indicate they are outside the selection but keep them visible.  \nTo use this feature, simply drag a field into this new field, well called ‘Highlight label’ in the Build visual pane.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-31333-3.png)  \nYou can now start interacting with now by simply selecting a value on a visual. For example, in the below example if you click on District L1-04 in the scatter chart, you will see the DM of the district L1-04 highlighted while other values are dimmed in the button slicer.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-31333-4.png)  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-31333-5.png)  \n**Auto grid**  \nWith the new Auto grid option turned on, your slicer layout becomes smarter.

No more manual resizing to fill the gap.  \nIf your table isn’t using the full visual width, you can manually resize columns or use Auto-size width, but now there’s an improved solution. For example, this table doesn’t fully utilize the available space:  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-31333-8.png)  \nNavigate to the format pane under Column headers > Options, toggle Auto-size width to ‘On’, and set ‘Resize behavior’ to ‘Grow to fit’.

As adoption has grown, many of you expressed the need for a centralized mechanism to manage and update several Power BI add-ins across multiple slides. You told us that you are using Power BI add-in for PowerPoint to create data-centric presentations, which you are updating every week or month, and that going over all the add-ins in the presentation and repeating the same operation is time consuming. The Power BI Controller addresses this need by allowing users to execute bulk operations from a single interface.  \nThe Power BI Controller is a task pane add-in that serves as a central command center for all Power BI add-ins within a presentation.  \nTo get this add-in go to ‘Add-ins’ in PowerPoint ribbon and search for ‘Microsoft Power BI Controller’. Select ‘Add’ to add-in to your ribbon. Once you select it, a new panel will open with the list of commands that you can apply. Pick the command you wish to run and click ‘Apply’. This will trigger the discovery phase in which the controller will look for all Power BI content in the presentation and next the selected command will be executed on the discovered Power BI add-ins.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/10/word-image-31333-11.png)  \nTo learn more, refer to [View and Present live Power BI Data in PowerPoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-view-present#add-in-side-pane).",

        "content": "## Culture and collation in a semantic model  \nIn the context of a semantic model, *culture* refers to the set of language and regional settings that dictate how data is displayed and interpreted for end users. This includes conventions for formatting numbers, dates, times, currency, and even textual sorting rules, all of which can vary dramatically across different locales. In addition to a model’s default culture, you can add translations that align with user expectations in a particular country or region. By aligning a semantic model’s culture with its intended audience, you can deliver reports and analytics that feel native, familiar, and accessible to users around the world.  \nFor more information about translations, refer to the [Use locale values in multiple-language Power BI reports](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/guidance/multiple-language-locale) documentation.  \n*Collation*, on the other hand, defines a set of rules that determines how textual data—such as strings or words—is sorted and compared within a semantic model. It influences the order in which text entries appear, how case sensitivity is handled, and how characters from different languages are interpreted during comparisons. Collation is essential for ensuring that sorting and searching behaviors reflect cultural and linguistic conventions, such as whether uppercase letters precede lowercase ones or whether certain accented characters are treated as distinct or equivalent. By adjusting the collation of a semantic model, you can support table relationships with inconsistent casing and process data in a way that feels correct and native to users’ expectations, regardless of their language or locale. One typical scenario is to align the collation of a Direct Lake model with the collation of the underlying Fabric lakehouse or warehouse so that DAX queries and SQL queries use the same sorting and comparison rules.",

        "content": "## Updating culture and collation in TOM  \nBy default, semantic models created in Power BI Desktop use the current culture of the operating system and are case-insensitive, but you can now leverage XMLA endpoints and the Tabular Object Model (TOM) through the latest [Analysis Services client libraries](https://learn.microsoft.com/analysis-services/client-libraries?view=sql-analysis-services-2025) to change culture and collation by using the UpdateCulture and UpdateCollation methods. You can also use the ResetCulture method to revert culture or collation to their original settings.  \nFor details, refer to the [Tabular Object Model (TOM) reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/analysis-services/tom/tom-pbi-datasets) in the product documentation.  \nNote that you must re-supply the data source credentials for all data connections after altering the default culture or collation of a semantic model hosted on SQL Server Analysis Services or Azure Analysis Services. This step is not necessary in Power BI.  \nThe following code snippet demonstrates how to set both the default culture and collation of a semantic model. The UpdateCulture method requires the *culture* argument. It must be a non-empty string. The *collation* argument is optional. If you only wish to fine-tune sorting and comparison rules without changing the culture, use the UpdateCollation method instead of UpdateCulture.  \n`Database database = server.Databases.FindByName(\"UpdateCulture Demo\");`\n`if (database == null)`\n`{`\n`throw new ApplicationException(`\n`\"Database 'UpdateCulture Demo' cannot be found!\");\n}`  \n`// Update collation and culture with sample values\nstring newCulture = \"en-US\";\nstring newCollation = \"Latin1_General_100_CI_AS\";\ndatabase.Model.UpdateCollation(culture: newCulture, collation: newCollation);\ndatabase.Model.SaveChanges();`",

Direct Lake on OneLake table storage mode already could mix tables from other Fabric data sources, such as lakehouses, warehouses, SQL databases in Fabric, and mirrored databases. And with this update, now that flexibility is extended much further with the ability to add in import tables from any data source, from 100s of connectors in Power Query online.  \nThe import tables added can also be from the same source as your Direct Lake tables. A small dimension table changed from Direct Lake to import can have a calculated column or the hierarchy usable in Analyze in Excel.

Instead, they now support collaborative editing scenarios with external tools, code file edits or AI.  \nThe TMDL view team has done an outstanding job extending Power BI hardening. As a result, Power BI Desktop now supports a wider range of semantic model configurations, including:  \n* Custom table partitions\n* Provider data sources\n* Semantic model columns with different names from data sources\n* … and more  \nBeyond these capabilities, the hardening work also unlocked two major Power BI features:  \n* The ability to download XMLA-altered semantic models as PBIX files.\n* Full support for external tools to perform any write operation on the semantic model running in Power BI Desktop.  \nThese enhancements make Power BI Desktop more flexible and resilient for advanced modeling scenarios – whether you’re working within Power BI tools, using external tools, writing code directly, or leveraging generative AI workflows.",

Until now, opening a report from a preview card would take over your Teams window, interrupting your workflow and making multitasking a challenge.  \nYou asked, we listened. This month, we’ve introduced a subtle but powerful change that replaces the previous experience: when someone shares a report (or any other Power BI item) in a Teams chat or channel, opening it now launches in a separate window. Your original chat stays put, tucked into a collapsible side panel.  \n* You can view the original chat alongside the report, making it easy to continue the conversation while exploring your data.\n* You can keep using Teams in the main window—switching between other chats, channels, or apps without losing your place.\n* Each chat opens a single report window, so you’re never juggling multiple pop-ups. If several preview cards are shared in the same conversation, the window simply updates with the latest item.  \nThis update makes it easier to collaborate, multitask, and stay in flow—all without leaving Teams.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/08/word-image-30844-1.gif)  \nA user clicks ‘Open’ on a Power BI report preview card within a Teams chat.

        "content": "## Advanced example: flexible currency conversion  \nTo illustrate how DAX UDFs can handle more complex logic, let’s look at a currency conversion scenario. The example below uses type checking and nested functions to convert an amount into a target currency using either the average or end-of-day exchange rate for a given date.  \n```\n/// converts a date to a datekey\nfunction convertDateToDateKey =\n( p_date: variant ) =>\nYEAR ( p_date ) * 10000 + MONTH ( p_date ) * 100 + DAY ( p_date )\n\n/// converts p_amount to p_currency, using the p_date’s average or end of day (default) rate.\nfunction convertToCurrency =\n(\np_currency: variant,\np_date: variant,\np_use_average_rate: boolean,\np_amount: decimal\n) =>\nvar currencyKey =\nIF(\nISINT64(p_currency),\np_currency,\nCALCULATE(MAX('Currency'[CurrencyKey]),'Currency'[Code]==p_currency)\n)\nvar dateKey =\nSWITCH (\nTRUE,\nISINT64 ( p_date ), p_date,\nconvertDateToDateKey ( p_date )\n)\nvar exchange_rate =\nIF (\np_use_average_rate,\nCALCULATE (\nMAX ( 'Currency Rate'[Average Rate] ),\n'Currency Rate'[DateKey] == dateKey,\n'Currency Rate'[CurrencyKey] == currencyKey\n),\nCALCULATE (\nMAX( 'Currency Rate'[End Of Day Rate] ),\n'Currency Rate'[DateKey] == dateKey,\n'Currency Rate'[CurrencyKey] == currencyKey\n)\n)\nvar result =\nIF (\nISBLANK ( p_currency ) || ISBLANK ( p_date ) || ISBLANK ( p_amount ),\nBLANK (),\nIF (\nISBLANK ( exchange_rate ),\n\"no exchange rate available\",\nexchange_rate * p_amount\n)\n)\nRETURN result\n```  \nThe convertToCurrency function defined above accepts flexible input types for both currency and date. Users can provide either a currencyKey or dateKey directly or supply a currencyCode or standard date value. The function checks the type of each input and handles it accordingly: if p\\_currency is a whole number, it’s treated as a currencyKey; otherwise, the function assumes a currencyCode and attempts to resolve the corresponding key. The p\\_date parameter follows a similar pattern and, when needed, is converted to a dateKey using the convertDateToDateKey helper function. If the function cannot determine a valid exchange rate, it returns the message: “no exchange rate available.”  \nThis logic can then be used to define a measure like Total Sales in Local Currency, and optionally paired with a [dynamic format string](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-dynamic-format-strings) to display the result in the appropriate currency format:  \n* Measure:  \n```\nTotal Sales in Local Currency =\nconvertToCurrency (\nSELECTEDVALUE ( 'Currency'[Code] ),\nSELECTEDVALUE ( 'Date'[DateKey] ),\nTRUE,\n[Total Sales]\n)\n```  \n* Dynamic format string:  \n```\nCALCULATE (\nMAX ( 'Currency'[Format String] ),\n'Currency'[Code] == SELECTEDVALUE ( 'Currency'[Code] )\n)\n```  \nHere is a working example:  \n![The Total Sales in Local Currency measure returns the Total Sales value in local currency and is formatted properly.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/08/a-screenshot-of-a-graph-ai-generated-content-may-2.png)",

        "content": "### Auto-selection of Copilot workspaces  \nIf you don’t have access to a [Fabric Copilot Capacity (FCC)](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/fabric-copilot-capacity), you can still use the [standalone Copilot experience](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-chat-with-data-standalone). However, you’ll need to manually select a Copilot workspace for billing and usage tracking. This step has caused confusion for many business users, as workspace names, eligibility rules, and billing details are often unfamiliar.  \nBeginning in late September, Copilot will automatically assign a workspace to each user, allowing them to access their environment without additional steps. You will still have full control to change their selection at any time, but the automatic selection will clear a roadblock and make it easier to start getting insights from Copilot.  \n**How auto-selection works**  \n* Smart distribution: We generate a partially randomized list of workspaces, weighted toward those with more available capacity. This helps balance usage and avoids overloading any single capacity.\n* Eligibility check: We’ll pick go down that list and pick a workspace tied to a capacity that meets [Copilot requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction#copilot-requirements) (in short, F2 or higher, in a supported region, enabled for use with Copilot).\n* Persistence: Once selected, the workspace stays set across sessions.\n* Fallbacks: If the workspace is later disabled for Copilot, we’ll automatically reassign a new one and alert the user. If an FCC becomes available, it will always override the auto-selected workspace.\n* User control: A dismissible notification will let users know which workspace was chosen, with a direct option to change it.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/copilot1-1024x456.png)![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/copilot2-1024x518.png)![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/copilot3.png)  \nYou can also update it anytime via More > Manage workspace in the standalone Copilot experience.  \n**Why this matters**  \nThis update clears friction for business users who want to use Copilot but don’t know (or need to know) the intricacies of capacities and workspace settings. By auto-selecting a workspace, we help them get straight to the insights they care about—while still giving admins and power users the flexibility to make changes as needed.",

This expansion will empower consumers to locate their Power BI reports and data directly from M365 environments where they already work. Since then, we’ve made significant progress; users can now find Power BI reports by searching for a variety of report content in both Microsoft 365 Search and Copilot.  \nNow, searching for a report title, description, chart title, or other contextual details within the report will display relevant Power BI items in M365, simplifying the process of finding reporting resources for daily data-driven decisions.  \n**Search for Power BI items in the M365 Copilot Search**  \n![A black and white background with white text  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-black-and-white-background-with-white-text-ai-g-1.png)![A screenshot of a computer  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-35.png)  \n**Search for Power BI items in the M365 Copilot Chat**  \n![A screenshot of a computer  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-36.png)  \nTo learn more about how to share Power BI data with M365 for your organization, refer to the[Share data with your Microsoft 365 services](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/admin/admin-share-power-bi-metadata-microsoft-365-services#how-to-turn-sharing-with-microsoft-365-services-on-and-off)documentation.",

        "content": "### Copilot search improvements  \nCopilot report descriptions make it easier to identify which report can answer your question without needing to open each one for verification. When the report author hasn’t added an item description, Copilot will provide a descriptive caption in Copilot search lists.  \n![A screenshot of a computer  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-37.png)  \nSearch prefers items that have been Prepped for AI. When content creators update the [Prepped for AI](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-prepare-data-ai#mark-your-model-as-prepped-for-ai) setting to indicate that a semantic model is ready for use with Copilot, search is now boosting that prepped content (both the model, and all reports that use it). Content that’s ready for Copilot will be preferred in Copilot search over equally relevant Certified & Promoted content. In addition, we’ve sped up the delay in applying the prepped status of the model to the report from 24 hours to under 1 hour (but usually just a few minutes) in most cases.  \n![Screenshot of the AI preparation settings in Power BI service, showcasing the option to mark a model as prepped for AI.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/screenshot-of-the-ai-preparation-settings-in-power-1.png)  \nHints for item types and workspaces, Copilot search returns results that are semantically like your question’s topic, which can be helpful when you don’t quite remember the report’s name. But often we remember other information that could help narrow the search. Copilot can now recognize the key concepts of workspaces and item types, which you can use to guide search.  \nIf you’re looking for a semantic model you created ages ago to model effective advertising spend, you might ask: ‘Find semantic models with fields about campaigns, ROI, and impressions’.  \nOr, if you want to prefer content in a particular location, you might say: ‘Summarize quarterly sales, from the workspace East Coast Only’. This won’t act as a strict filter, so if you have a workspace called ‘Excluding East Coast’, you might see results from that workspace because the workspace names are similar.  \nCopilot search responses will now prefer to surface just reports and data agents when the user doesn’t specify. Copilot can still use the report’s semantic model to answer the user’s question, but in this way, we’re focusing on items that users are more likely to recognize.  \nUpdates to support filter pass-through, you may have already noticed updates in how verified answers show up in our search lists. These changes are purposeful and support Copilot in honoring filter context. For example, when a question about tourism on O’ahu is submitted, it is useful if search indicates that someone has already verified the answer to a similar inquiry.  \nIf information is needed for a different island, and that selection is available as a filter in a commonly used report, Copilot can be directed to use that specific report.  \n![A screenshot of a chat  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-screenshot-of-a-chat-ai-generated-content-may-b-4.png)  \nIn the following example, the verified answer is used as a starting point but filtered to directly answer my original question. You can find the filters applied to the visualization.  \n![A screenshot of a computer  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-38.png)  \nWhen you use Copilot to search, you’ll now see recommendations for what to do next, such as summarizing the report or providing an overview of the key metrics.  \n![A screenshot of a chat  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-screenshot-of-a-chat-ai-generated-content-may-b-5.png)  \nLearn more about these features and how Copilot search works in the [Find content with Power BI Copilot search](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-search-new-content) documentation.",

With this update, you can now define custom calendars—such as fiscal years or 4-5-4 retail calendars—directly in your data model. This gives you precise control over how your data maps over time, enabling more accurate and flexible analysis. What’s more, it allows you to do week-based calculations as well!  \n**Basic example using a Gregorian calendar**  \nHow to use calendars to perform a total month-to-date calculation on a Gregorian calendar:  \n1. To get started, simply turn on the ‘Enhanced DAX Time Intelligence’ feature in preview settings.\n2. Select Calendar options from the context menu on your date table.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/calendar-options-context-menu.png)  \n1. Create a calendar by associating columns in your date table into categories.\n* Example:The Gregorian Calendar below maps the Year, Quarter, Month, Month of Year and Date categories to primary and associated columns (Columns can be named as desired).  \n![A calendar customization interface titled \"Demo Calendar.\" It includes a \"+ Add category\" button, a \"Validate data\" button, and a table with columns for Category, Primary column, and Associated columns.

Perform calculations based on your calendar.\n* **Example:** If you have a calendar called ‘Gregorian Calendar’ defined in your model, you can use TOTALMTD to calculate a month-to-date total sales value based on that:  \n```\nSales MTD = TOTALMTD ( [Total Sales], 'Gregorian Calendar' )\n```  \nIn addition to expanding existing functions with support for calendars, we have also added brand new functions that allow you to do week-based calculations as well, such as [TOTALWTD](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/totalwtd-function-dax), [PREVIOUSWEEK](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/previousweek-function-dax) and more.  \n1. Show your result in a visual.\n* **Example:** This chart shows the Total Sales and Sales MTD value we calculated previously.  \n![Actual total sales and Sales MTD](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/actual-total-sales-and-sales-mtd-1.png)  \n**Working with fiscal calendars**  \nMany calendars, particularly fiscal calendars, are shifted Gregorian calendars, in which the year does not being on January 1st, but for example on July 1st. Microsoft is an example of a company that uses a shifted fiscal calendar.  \nIn this case, a date table would include columns for the fiscal periods, such as fiscal year, fiscal quarter and fiscal month:  \n![Example data for a fiscal calendar.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/example-data-for-a-fiscal-calendar-1-1.png)  \nNow, you can define a Fiscal Calendar:  \n![Defining a Fiscal Calendar.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/defining-a-fiscal-calendar-1-1.png)  \nYou can use the calendar in our calculations, for example, this calculates the [SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/sameperiodlastyear-function-dax) value using the Fiscal Calendar:  \n```\nSales Same Period Last Fiscal Year = CALCULATE ( [Total Sales], SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR( 'Fiscal Calendar' ) )\n```  \nThis can then be visualized as follows:  \n![A graph of blue bars  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-graph-of-blue-bars-ai-generated-content-may-be-1.png)  \n**Week-based calculations**  \nAs mentioned, you can now also perform week-based calculations, including 454 and other patterns. After making sure your data table contains week information, associate the relevant categories in your calendar as done below for a 454 calendar:  \n![Setting up a 454 calendar](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/setting-up-a-454-calendar-1.png)  \nNext, create your DAX calculation, for example, a week-to-date calculation can be made using [TOTALWTD](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/totalwtd-function-dax):  \n```\nSales WTD 454 = TOTALWTD ( [Total Sales], 'RETAIL-454' )\n```  \nThe column chart shows the actual and the week-to-date sales value based on our RETAIL-454 calendar.  \n![showing total sales and Sales WTD 454.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/showing-total-sales-and-sales-wtd-454-1-1.png)  \nThere is much more to learn about this feature as it allows for a lot of advanced scenarios.  \nLearn more about [this preview in our time intelligence](https://aka.ms/powerbi-calendar-TI-docs) documentation and try it out in your next report and let us know what you think!",

        "content": "### Download PBIX of XMLA altered semantic models  \nA key goal of the TMDL view work was to ensure Power BI Desktop can reliably handle any semantic model configuration. If the model is valid in Analysis Services in a Fabric workspace, it can be opened and edited in Power BI Desktop without crashing. Semantic model metadata not accessible through the user interface – such as multiple table partitions – can still be edited using TMDL view.  \nPreviously, users could use the [XMLA endpoint with external tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/enterprise/powerbi/service-premium-connect-tools) to make semantic model changes – such as creating multiple partitions – that were supported by Fabric but not by Power BI Desktop. This mismatch often caused Power BI Desktop to crash, which is why downloads were blocked for XMLA altered semantic models. Now that TMDL view is generally available, we’ve removed this limitation. You can now download PBIX files for semantic models modified through the XMLA endpoint, and open and edit them in Power BI Desktop.  \n![A screenshot of a computer  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-45.png)  \nThis update does not mean that all semantic models are now downloadable as PBIX files. For example, semantic models with incremental refresh partitions are still not supported for download, this will be addressed in a future update. For more details on PBIX download limitations, please refer to our [Limitations when downloading a report .pbix file](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/service-export-to-pbix#limitations-when-downloading-a-report-pbix-file) documentation.  \nThis feature is currently rolling out and may not be fully available in all regions or for all users yet.

        "content": "### DAX User Defined Functions (Preview)  \nPower BI has long supported [custom functions in Power Query](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-query/custom-function), however now DAX User Defined Functions (UDFs) provide similar capabilities. DAX UDFs allow you to define custom functions with parameters, just like you would define functions or methods in programming. Instead of copy-pasting chunks of logic across multiple measures, you can now write your logic once and reuse it everywhere.  \nComplex problems can be encapsulated by multiple reusable functions. Functions can even refer to other functions! This way, your logic becomes easier to write, understand, maintain and debug. Whether you are working on complex models or just want cleaner, more maintainable code, DAX UDFs are for you.  \nUp to this point, the reusability of DAX logic was limited to [calculation groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/calculation-groups). DAX UDFs, however, unlike calculation groups, can be parameterized.  \n**Getting started with DAX UDFs**  \nTo get started, simply turn on the ‘DAX User Defined Functions’ feature in the preview settings. You can define DAX UDFs in multiple ways, including the [DAX Query View](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/dax-query-view) and [TMDL view](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-tmdl-view).  \n**Defining and using a function**  \nDefining a function is straightforward as we have introduced a new FUNCTION keyword. The general structure for defining a function is:  \n```\n/// [function description]\n\nFUNCTION <FunctionName> = ( [parameter name] : [parameter type] ) => <body>\n```  \nFor example, here is a DAX query that defines and evaluates an extremely simple function that applies a 10% tax to an amount.  \n```\nDEFINE\n/// AddTax returns the amount including tax\nFUNCTION AddTax = (amount) =>\namount * 1.1\n\nEVALUATE {\nAddTax(11)\n} // Return 11\n```  \nAfter adding the function to the model, you can then call the function from other places where you can use DAX, such as measures:  \n![While referring to a UDF, the description is shown in the formula bar.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/while-referring-to-a-udf-the-description-is-shown-1.png)  \n**Parameters**  \nJust like built-in functions, DAX UDFs can take zero or more parameters. You can also provide the type of the parameter, so your functions are much more resilient. For example, to identify that our AddTax function expects a numerical value, we could write.  \n```\nDEFINE\n/// AddTax returns the amount including tax\nFUNCTION AddTax = (amount: numeric) =>\namount * 1.1\n```  \nParameters can not only take scalar values but also accept tables and even expressions.  \n**Type checking**  \nTo make DAX and TMDL/TMSL more consistent, we have introduced a set of new functions to do type checking and updated the [DATATABLE](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/datatable-function-dax), [CONVERT](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/convert-function-dax) and [EXTERNALMEASURE](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/externalmeasure-function-dax) functions have been updated to work with all synonyms as well. For example, we now have added [ISSTRING](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/isstring-function-dax), which is an alternative to, [ISTEXT](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/istext-function-dax) and [ISNUMERIC](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/isnumeric-function-dax) which is a complement to [ISNUMBER](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/isnumber-function-dax).  \n[A complete list](https://aka.ms/powerbi-dax-UDFs-docs) is available in our documentation.  \n**Managing DAX UDFs**  \nFunctions are shown in the model explorer:  \n![UDFs are shown in the model explorer.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/udfs-are-shown-in-the-model-explorer-1-1.png)  \nIn DAX Query View, we even added quick queries, so it’s even easier to define and evaluate existing functions or write a brand new one.  \n![In Dax Query View, you can use quick queries on functions to evaluate, define and evaluate a function, or define a new function or define all functions in this model.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/in-dax-query-view-you-can-use-quick-queries-on-fu-1.png)  \n**The possibilities are endless**  \nDAX UDFs open a whole new spectrum of options, and this blog cannot do it justice. We encourage you to enable the preview today and try it out for yourself.  \nRead more in the [Power BI DAX User Data Functions](https://aka.ms/powerbi-dax-UDFs-docs) documentation. Please let us know what you think. We are looking forward to seeing all the creative uses of UDFs!",

While this behavior is convenient in most cases, there are scenarios where you may want to refresh the data without updating the model schema, even if the data source has changed its schema.  \nFor example, in Direct Lake semantic models, the underlying Lakehouse table might have changed (e.g., a new column added).

You can choose to:  \n* Sync schemaonly – Updates the semantic model to reflect the data source structure (e.g., column type changes or new columns).\n* Refresh dataonly – Loads fresh data while preserving the current schema in your semantic model.  \nThese options are also available when you refresh tables individually in the data pane:  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/sept1-922x1024.png)  \nThis added flexibility helps you manage your models refresh operations more intentionally, based on your specific needs.  \nFor more information about Power BI Desktop refresh, refer to the [Data refresh in Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/connect-data/refresh-data#Power-BI-Desktop-refresh-options) documentation.",

Simply add a column to your dataset, define the logic with symbols (“**=**”(Result), “**/**”(Skip), “**–**”(Invert)), and with a single drag and drop add it to Zebra BI Tables. The column values will automatically be applied as calculations on the visual, eliminating the need for additional manual setup. It makes the creation of reports like **P&Ls, balance sheets, inventory tracking, SaaS metrics, or sales dashboards** dramatically faster and more accurate.  \n![A screenshot of a computer  \nAI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/09/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-59.png)  \nZebra BI Tables now also supports [adding brand images](https://zebrabi.com/product-update/product-update-may2025/)instead of row labels. Especially valuable for consumer goods and retail companies, this feature makes reports more intuitive and engaging.

Existing models will continue to refresh until September 15th, at which point they will no longer be supported, and Azure ML and Cognitive services will be fully retired. This is true for desktop and service options.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-1.png)  \nLeveraging machine learning in Power BI through cognitive services and Azure Machine learnings models is a useful feature in Power BI that enables customers to easily create and deploy machine learning models for predictive analytics. However, we have received feedback that customers want more control, scale and flexibility over the end-to-end pipeline.  \nWe can achieve more flexibility and control with other options. The AutoML solution based on Synapse Data Science in Microsoft Fabric will help address this by offering customers a powerful and more customizable machine learning experience, with access to advanced tools and features.  \nWith the AutoML feature in Fabric, you can automate your machine learning workflow and get the best results with less effort. AutoML in Fabric, or Automated Machine Learning, is a set of techniques and tools that can automatically train and optimize machine learning models for any given data and task type. You don’t need to worry about choosing the right model and hyperparameters, as AutoML will do that for you.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-2.png)  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/image-3.png)  \nWe also recommend using Azure AI services for advanced capabilities like text analytics and script translation. These services can be integrated directly into Microsoft Fabric to enable deeper customization and more powerful machine learning features, all while taking advantage of the broader benefits of running ML workloads in Fabric. [Use Azure AI services in Fabric – Microsoft Fabric | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/ai-services/ai-services-overview#text-analytics)  \nWe strongly encourage customers to migrate their ML solutions to Fabric or directly to Azure AI rest apis, as existing machine learning features in Power BI will be phased out soon.  \n**Please note**  \nBeginning August 11th, customers will not be able to create new models via cognitive services, all UI entry points will be removed. Your existing models that leverage AI services will continue to refresh until September 15th, at which point there will no longer be any refresh support for those that leverage retired cognitive services and/or AzureML.  \n**Next steps**  \nTo learn more about the alternative solutions, refer to the documentation:  \n[Use Azure AI services in Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-science/ai-services/ai-services-overview)  \n[Use AutoML in Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/fabric/data-science/automated-machine-learning-fabric)",

From LinkedIn posts highlighting favorite dashboards to nostalgic tweets on X (formerly Twitter) reflecting on the platform’s early days, it’s been incredible to witness the outpouring of memories and creativity.  \nLeonardo Almeida recalled building a Power BI report back in 2015 that caught the attention of the President of Brazil and the Minister of Education. Christos Demertzis looked back on a decade-long journey with Power BI, saying, “I still have reports sitting in My Workspace from those early days, and looking back at them now… just WOW. The evolution of the platform has been nothing short of incredible.” And Mike Honey congratulated the Power BI team, sharing, “I clearly remember how electrifying it was when it all came together as Power BI. The product has been my primary focus ever since and has certainly kept me busy. May that continue for the next 10 years!”  \nIn our community’s Career Hub forums, you can find stories of accountants, teachers, and marketing specialists who taught themselves Power BI and transitioned into roles such as BI analysts and data engineers. Companies of all sizes are investing in Power BI training to up-skill their workforce, recognizing that a data-literate workforce gives them a competitive edge.  \nThe Power BI Community Forums started with a few thousand early adopters and have grown into millions of members today, sharing knowledge daily. Over 200 Power BI & Fabric User Groups have connected over members with meetups and events.

That’s why Power BI has enabled customers who use both Microsoft 365 services and Power BI to share core item metadata to make it easier for office workers to get more done. We’re extending this integration so that we can improve Power BI item discovery & search relevancy from M365 Copilot experiences & Office search.  \nThe previous version of M365 data sharing was limited to barebones metadata like report names and creation dates. To enable consumers to find data from where they usually work in M365, Power BI will begin sending more context about reports to M365 services. From chart titles and the descriptive text on your dashboards to the model’s last refreshed date, we know this extended metadata will make it easier to find the right reporting to make a data-driven decision.  \nJune 2025 marks a change of terms for the scope of the data shared as controlled by the tenant admin setting. To learn more, refer to the [Share data with your Microsoft 365 services](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/admin/admin-share-power-bi-metadata-microsoft-365-services#how-to-turn-sharing-with-microsoft-365-services-on-and-off) documentation.  \nStay tuned for updates in the upcoming months as new capabilities are shared.",

Reports contain curated data already shaped by the report author — when Copilot takes cues from that analysis instead of starting from scratch it leads to better, more relevant answers with less guesswork.  \nFull details can be found in the [Standalone Copilot experience in Power BI (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-chat-with-data-standalone) documentation.

        "content": "### Limit Copilot search to prepped content  \nAre you interested in trying Power BI’s standalone Copilot but prefer not to engage with all your data? Many users have indicated that having broad controls for Copilot search is crucial for data teams as they prepare models for AI use. Often, teams seek the capability to test Copilot with specific reports or workspaces while completely hiding others.  \nAdmin settings have been introduced to support these use cases. Tenant admins can now set the default behavior for Power BI’s standalone Copilot to limit search responses to only items that creators have marked as Prepped for use with AI. Workspace admins can refine that control using the delegated workspace setting to allow Copilot to search across all content, or limit focusing on just prepped content.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m.png)  \nThese settings will **only** affect the search functionality of Copilot. It is designed to give admins control to mitigate the risk of Copilot finding an ill-maintained or purpose-built report in a corner of your PBI tenant and using that report to answer a user’s data question.  \nAttaching an item directly allows data teams to test Copilot with new reports before they’re ready, while business users can still get assistance from Copilot with their preferred reports. We encourage you to configure these settings to establish default behaviors that align with your organization’s needs and to utilize workspace settings to help your team access the most relevant content.  \nTenant admins can find details in the [tenant settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/admin/service-admin-portal-copilot#only-show-ai-prepped-items-in-the-standalone-copilot-in-power-bi-experience-preview) documentation.

These questions are defined by data creators and mapped to visualizations that have been curated by content creators as the right answer to these questions. Creators can learn more about how & when to create verified answers as part of [Preparing your data for AI – Verified answers](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-prepare-data-ai-verified-answers) documentation.  \nThe question approved by the creator for the visual is included in the results list. This may closely match your original wording or simply contain related keywords. We display the question (also referred to as the prompt) to confirm its suitability as a starting point for Copilot to address your inquiry.  \n![Common questions to human-reviewed answers will now show as suggested content to answer your data questions from Copilot.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/common-questions-to-human-reviewed-answers-will-no.png)  \nIn this example, the first two options appear promising according to different reports. You can view the verified answers by typing ‘show me the first’ or by clicking the button ‘Use 1’. It is also possible to extend the conversation by requesting a summary of the associated report from Copilot, or by asking for a breakdown of veggie pizza sales by quarter.  \nAs you continue to experiment with Copilot, we look forward to your feedback on how verified answers show up in our experiences and what you’re hoping for next.

Previously available in window functions like [INDEX](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/index-function-dax), [OFFSET](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/offset-function-dax) and [WINDOW](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/window-function-dax), this option is now included in functions such as [RUNNINGSUM](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/runningsum-function-dax), [MOVINGAVERAGE](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/movingaverage-function-dax), [PREVIOUS](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/previous-function-dax), and more.  \nThis improvement increases the flexibility and capability of visual calculations, allowing for advanced computations based on data sorting. For instance, you can now use [RUNNINGSUM](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/runningsum-function-dax) for Pareto analysis by sorting data in descending order.  \nTo visualize your top-selling product colors, use a chart as demonstrated in the example:  \n![A blue bar graph with black text AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-blue-bar-graph-with-black-text-ai-generated-con.png)  \nThis chart is sorted by sales amount in descending order, so the colors are not arranged alphabetically. To include the Pareto analysis, first calculate the percentage of the grand total sales that each color represents, using the provided visual calculation template ‘Percent of grand total’:  \n```\nPercent of grand total = DIVIDE ( [Sales Amount], COLLAPSEALL ( [Sales Amount], ROWS ) )\n```  \nNext, include the Pareto line by employing another visual calculation using the ‘Running sum’ template:  \n```\nPareto = RUNNINGSUM ( [Percent of grand total] )\n```  \nHowever, this issue arises because the colors are not organized alphabetically in the visual representation, only within the matrix.  \n![A graph with blue lines AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-graph-with-blue-lines-ai-generated-content-may.png)  \nCreating a true Pareto line requires a more complex DAX statement, for example using [SUMX](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/sumx-function-dax) and [WINDOW](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/window-function-dax):  \n```\nPareto using WINDOW =\n\nSUMX (\n\nWINDOW ( 0, ABS, 0, REL, ROWS, ORDERBY ( [Sales Amount], DESC ) ),\n\n[Percent of grand total]\n\n)\n```  \nWhile this method is functional, utilizing RUNNINGSUM with the new ORDERBY parameter offers greater convenience. It significantly simplifies the process of adding the Pareto line:  \n```\nEasy Pareto = RUNNINGSUM ( [Percent of grand total], ORDERBY ( [Sales Amount], DESC ) )\n```  \nFollowing a brief application of [visual level formatting](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/desktop-custom-format-strings#add-a-visual-level-format-string), your Pareto analysis is complete:  \n![A graph with a line going up AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-graph-with-a-line-going-up-ai-generated-content.png)  \nThis is an example of how this new parameter enables more advanced and flexible calculations using visual methods. We encourage you to try it and share your feedback with us! To learn more about [visual calculations](https://aka.ms/visual-calculations-docs), refer to the documentation.",

        "content": "### Field parameters (Generally Available)  \nYes, you read that right, [Field parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/power-bi-field-parameters) are now generally available! This fan-favorite has been popular since its introduction in [May 2022](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/power-bi-may-2022-feature-summary/#post-19361-_Toc103022212), because it allows users to dynamically change the measures or dimensions being analyzed within a report. It enables end-users to tailor the analysis within the report by selecting specific measures or dimensions of interest.  \nThis month, we improved how a matrix retains its expanded or collapsed state. Previously, if using a field parameter in an expanded matrix and switching the dimension or measuring the parameter selected, the matrix would collapse. Starting this month, efforts have been made to keep the matrix in the same state as possible. While it is not always possible or desirable to keep the same expansion state, it can often be useful. For example, in a matrix that shows sales by Product Category, a field parameter called Product Aspect can be added to allow choosing between product Class, Color, and Model. Upon selecting the product Class and expanding the first Product Category node (Accessories), the matrix appears as follows:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-4.png)  \nNow, switching the column selected by the Product Aspect field parameter to Color will no longer collapse the entire matrix. Instead, starting this month, the expand and collapse state is preserved as much as possible. Therefore, when transitioning to Color, the initial Product Category (Accessories) remains expanded:  \n![A screenshot of a product category AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-screenshot-of-a-product-category-ai-generated-c.png)  \nTo refine the scenario, we will categorize Product Aspect as the primary level, with Product Category as the secondary level. Please expand the Color ‘Black’ to review the sales distribution for each Product Category within this Color:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-5.png)  \nSwitching Product Aspect to Class will expand the matrix for all classes due to the data split by Product Category. Without the ‘Black’ value (since Color is removed), we can’t keep that specific item expanded, so we default to expanding the whole field selected by the Product Aspect parameter to maintain detail.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-6.png)  \nTo collapse everything up to Class, utilize the Drill up button located in the visual header:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-7.png)  \nWith this latest addition to field parameters, they are now generally available.

Additionally, collaboration with the open-source community enables more rapid updates, utilizing modern tools and secure development lifecycle (SDL) processes.  \nFor example, when comparing the ODBC implementation (1.0) to the new ADBC implementation (2.0) using the [NYC Taxi and Limousine green dataset](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/open-datasets/dataset-taxi-green?tabs=azureml-opendatasets), the load time improvements were measured as:  \n![A screenshot of a computer screen AI-generated content may be incorrect., Picture](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/07/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-screen-ai-generated-co.png)  \nWe greatly appreciate your trial and feedback on this connector since the preview in January 2025. Along with this GA release, we’ve upgraded the connector with the following improvement:  \n* Boolean columns return Boolean types, fixing the issue where Boolean columns were treated as String types in an empty record set schema (including metadata).\n* New setting to set the maximum timestamp precision to microseconds.\n* Improved Duration support.\n* Added support for navigation properties to ADBC.\n* Improved tracing in the ADBC driver, where the ActivityId can now be traced through the driver layer.  \nBeginning in July 2025, all newly established connections will use this implementation by default to incorporate performance and security updates. In addition, we will gradually transition existing customers to the 2.0 implementation in phases, with updates being applied to different regions through November 2025. During this period, you can continue testing the 2.0 implementation by using the **Implementation=2.0** option on your Snowflake connections. Following the transition, connections without a specified implementation will be automatically assigned to the 2.0 implementation.  \nTo learn more, refer to the[Snowflake connector](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-query/connectors/snowflake)documentation.",

This layered visualization allows for direct comparison between trends and totals, helping users:  \n* Identify patterns and deviations.\n* Spot mismatches between volume and value,\n* Extract deeper, actionable insights briefly.  \nThe visual supports rich customization options, allowing users to configure the stacking, color schemes, and axis formatting to suit specific analytic goals.

We’ve expanded the experience to make it even more useful and report aware. Previously, Copilot could provide high-level summaries of report data and answer questions from the semantic model. Now, it goes a step further:  \n* You can ask Copilot natural language questions directly about report data, and it will generate answers using the actual visuals from your report – those same visuals that authors intentionally designed to answer real business questions.\n* Copilot will render report visuals in the chat with your data experience as part of the responses for clarity and transparency, making it easy to trace insights back to the data.\n* Report answers/summaries can now handle superlative/ranking questions more intelligently (e.g., ‘Which product had the highest sales?’). If visuals in your report can be sorted (like bar charts, tables, or matrices) Copilot can sort and surface that data to answer with accuracy.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/IMage-5.png)  \n**Smarter Email Subscriptions: Copilot Summaries + Narrative Visuals**  \nRecently, we announced that report subscriptions can be enhanced with Copilot summaries. Subscription emails can include a Copilot-generated summary at the top, offering a high-level overview of major trends, patterns, and KPIs.

These narrative visuals are key parts of reports and provide targeted, human-readable insights, making it easier to digest the report at a glance.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image3.png)  \nWhether you’re a stakeholder scanning your inbox or a user looking for quick insights, these updates reduce the time it takes to get oriented and increase the value of your subscriptions.  \n**Narrative Visuals Now Included in Exported Reports**  \nLastly, we’re making it easier to preserve narrative insights when sharing reports externally. The narrative visual is now supported in PDF and PowerPoint exports via the “Export as screenshot” (static data) options in Power BI.  \nThis means reports that include smart narrative summaries can now carry that context forward when exported, ensuring that the story behind the data remains intact for all audiences.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Image4.png)  \n✅ Available now in static/screenshot exports.\n⏳ Live connect exports support coming.  \nThese updates are part of our broader vision to make Copilot a seamless companion throughout your Power BI experience, helping you quickly understand, navigate, and communicate the value of your data. More exciting updates are on the way, including one of the most anticipated: filtered report responses. Copilot will be able to understand filters in your questions and respond with filtered data. Stay tuned!  \nWe can’t wait to see how you’ll use these new capabilities to unlock even more value from your reports.",

Today, it’s seamlessly integrated and a core part of Fabric, providing a complete data foundation with built-in Copilot capabilities and deep integration across the platform.  \nWith just one click, Power BI users can leverage the full power of Fabric. They can analyze data in semantic models, use Python notebooks with Semantic Link, set up real-time alerting using Real-Time Intelligence capabilities, and achieve fast performance on big data. As we continue to evolve Microsoft Fabric, a core tenet we will continue to pursue is how we empower and upskill our Power BI creators with new tools in Fabric.

That’s why we launched Copilot in Power BI.

One of the most exciting recent additions is *chat with your data*, now in preview. *Chat with your data* lets users engage in a full-screen, standalone copilot experience with natural language. Without opening specific reports, users can now search for relevant insights, analyze trends, and ask questions across reports, semantic models, and even Fabric data agents. Copilot can now intelligently retrieve and reason over all the data a user has access to, wherever it resides. We’re also working to extend Copilot in Power BI capabilities into Microsoft 365 Copilot withPower BI agent, allowing users to find content, ask questions, and visually explore and analyze data within the Microsoft 365 Copilot experience.  \nThoughtfully preparing data is the foundation for building reliable and scalable AI solutions. At [Microsoft Build 2025](https://build.microsoft.com/home), we introduced new capabilities to help users better prepare their data for Copilot. This conversational experience removes barriers, and helps users get to insights faster. It empowers everyone, from business analysts to data scientists, to work more confidently, make faster decisions, and navigate complex datasets directly with the familiar tools they already use.",

        "content": "## **Empowering data professionals in Power BI**  \nOver the past year, we introduced a range of new features for data professionals across the spectrum to work faster, smarter, and with more flexibility. In today’s landscape, businesses need to make big decisions faster, but many organizations still rely on transactional systems to handle operations, and separate analytical systems to process that data later for insights. With our latest announcement of translytical task flows, in preview right now, we’re blending the gap between transactional and analytical systems. Instead of switching between different systems or waiting for reports to update, users can act on insights directly from dashboards, streamlining decision-to-action cycles.  \nThe introduction of Tabular Model Definition Language ([TMDL views](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/deep-dive-into-tmdl-view-for-power-bi-desktop-preview/)) benefits power users byproviding a code-based approach to interacting with data models.It allows for easier management, editing, and collaboration on complex datasets through scripting-based workflows, unlocking scenarios that were previously out of reach. We also introduced a centralized Fabric metrics layer within Power BI, enabling organizations to define, discover, and reuse trusted metrics across reports and dashboards. This fosters data consistency, reduces duplicated metric definitions, and strengthens governance by ensuring that all teams draw insights from the same standardized calculations.  \nWe also rolled out a series of visualization and reporting enhancements designed to help enterprises work faster and smarter. New visuals like advanced Azure Maps layers and preview slicers give report designers more flexibility. The “Explore this data” feature enables business users to pivot, filter, and drill into any chart in seconds without leaving their report. Behind the scenes, publishing improvements—such as workspace folders, personalized email subscriptions, and the ability to access reports directly from OneDrive or SharePoint—make it easier to share insights at scale, and the PowerPoint integration got smarter with the reset-sync option. On the Desktop side, an enhanced Dark Mode UI makes long hours of building reports easier on the eyes.  \nWith these updates, Power BI is more interactive, more customizable, and more collaborative than ever for end-users.",

        "content": "## **See why customers love using Power BI and Fabric**  \nOver the past year, we’ve introduced hundreds of new capabilities across Power BI and Microsoft Fabric that help organizations turn data into action faster than ever. We’re seeing customers already putting these latest innovations to work, driving real impact across their teams.  \n[Lumen Technologies,](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/23991-lumen-microsoft-fabric)for example, adopted Microsoft Fabric to unify data ingestion, storage, and analytics. Using OneLake, Spark notebooks, Direct Lake, and Power BI, they built governed data models, automated pipelines, and delivered real-time insights across the business. This shift eliminated 10,000 hours of manual work, reduced infrastructure costs, and improved lead targeting. With Direct Lake, Lumen was able to access data instantly, giving teams a consistent, governed view of key metrics that support smarter decisions. “There are no refresh cycles, no latency. It just works,” says William Whittenton, Senior Business Intelligence Developer at Lumen.  \n[Make-A-Wish Foundation](https://www.microsoft.com/en/customers/story/23911-make-a-wish-azure) is another organization that enhanced its mission by integrating Power BI and Microsoft Fabric into its operations. To improve visibility, Make-A-Wish used Power BI and Fabric to create dashboards for each of its chapters, which CIO Russ Goodwin described as “real-time report cards.” Integrated with Fabric as a unified data source, these dashboards are now connected to multiple systems and enable deeper insights into wish granting, revenue, budgeting, and more. This integrated approach improved visibility, streamlined operations, and empowered local chapters to better plan and deliver impact, helping Make-A-Wish grant more life-changing wishes.  \nWant to see how other organizations are using Microsoft Fabric to drive results?

Now, after download, these models can be opened for editing with Power BI Desktop and Fabric web modelling, and any metadata not accessible through the user interface can be edited using [TMDL view](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-tmdl-view).  \n[External tools](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-external-tools) have become part of the Power BI ecosystem, particularly for semantic modeling. This update is very important for external tool users. Previously, certain write operations, such as adding new tables or editing query expressions, were not possible. **Now, external tools can be used for any write operations on the semantic model running in Power BI Desktop.**  \nIllustrated in the example is a semantic model featuring table partitions, originally [migrated from Azure Analysis Services to Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/aas-pbi-migration-overview \"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/enterprise/aas-pbi-migration-overview\"), opened for editing in the Fabric.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-149.png)",

        "content": "## General  \n### Secure Collaboration on Sensitive Data in Power BI Desktop  \nWorking with sensitive data in Power BI? Want to collaborate with teammates, without putting that data at risk? Good news: the latest Sensitivity Labels update for Power BI Desktop makes it easier than ever to **protect your files while still working together**.  \nLet’s break it down.  \n**What are sensitivity labels, and why should you care?**  \nYou can set **sensitivity labels** to classify your Power BI files—for *confidential* or *internal use only*. Once applied, you gain the following benefits:  \n* Complying with organization policies by classifying your data.\n* Enable sensitivity label continuity back to Power BI service and Fabric.\n* Encrypt the file according to your organization’s requirements.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-120.png)  \n**What’s been done so far?**  \nTo open a PBIX file, you either have to be the **label issuer** or have one of the [following usage rights](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/enterprise/service-security-sensitivity-label-overview#:~:text=To%20open%20a%20protected%20.pbix%20file%2C%20a%20user%20with%20an%20appropriate%20license%20must%20also%20have%20Full%20control%20and/or%20Export%20usage%20rights%20for%20the%20relevant%20label.%20See%20more%20detail.).  \nThese usage rights grant elevated permission, as they grant permission to change the sensitivity label. Because Power BI and Office apps use the same label policies, compliance admins may prefer not to grant these usage rights for highly confidential labels.  \nThis might block you from collaborating with your colleagues when you’re sharing or downloading Power BI reports and trying to open them in the desktop app.  \n**What’s new?**  \nWith this upcoming update, working with protected Power BI files is smoother than ever:  \n**Seamless collaboration with protected files**\nNow, more users in your organization can:  \n* Open encrypted PBIX files while remaining compliant to the label permissions.\n* Edit them directly in Power BI Desktop.\n* Republish them securely—only to the original workspace.  \nThat means easier teamwork, without compromising security or compliance.  \n**What is still restricted?**  \nTo maintain protection and policy enforcement, a few limits still apply when working with labeled files:  \n* Exporting to unsupported formats is blocked, including:\n+ CSV\n+ PBIT\n+ PBIP\n* You can only republish it back to its original workspace.\n* You can’t change the sensitivity label in Power BI Desktop.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-121.png)  \nThese safeguards help prevent accidental leaks and unauthorized distribution.  \n**How to get started**  \nTo take advantage of this update, here’s what needs to be in place:  \n**1. Ensure users have the correct usage rights on the sensitivity label**\nThe Microsoft Purview compliance admin should assign the following usage rights:  \n* View Content (VIEW)\n* Edit Content (DOCEDIT)\n* Save (EDIT)\n* Copy and extract content (EXTRACT)\n* Allow Macros (OBJMODEL)  \nThese permissions allow users to securely open, edit, and republish protected files in Power BI Desktop.  \n**Note:** These rights are a subset of the built-in ‘editor’ (previously named ‘co-author’) permission preset in the Microsoft Purview compliance center.  \n**2. Enable information Protection in the Power BI Admin Portal**\nPower BI admins must ensure the **Information Protection** feature is enabled.\nThat’s it—no tenant switches or preview feature toggles in desktop required.  \nPower BI Desktop now makes it simpler and safer to collaborate on sensitive data. With the new encryption update, you get:  \n* Protection that travels with the file\n* Secure, real-time collaboration\n* No extra configuration or friction  \nWhether you’re reporting on financials, customer data, or internal KPIs, you can now work confidently and compliantly—right out of the box.",

        "content": "## Reporting  \n### Updates to visual calculations (Preview)  \nWe have several updates for visual calculations this month. We are not only taking initial steps towards achieving the vision of reducing the need for typing, but we are also enhancing the robustness of visual calculations, so they are less prone to error when the visual type is changed. To top it off, we are adding visual calculations in [Explore](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/explore-data-service).  \nTo learn more, refer to the [visual calculations](https://aka.ms/visual-calculations-docs) documentation.  \n***Create visual calculations faster with parameter pickers***  \nIt is now even easier and faster to write visual calculations thanks to the parameter pickers. When you load a template or use one of the [functions exclusive to visual calculations](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview#available-functions), the parameter pickers for all required parameters with defined options will appear.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-122.png)  \nThen it’s just a matter of selecting the value you want from the drop down and you’re done. A couple of clicks is all that is needed. This makes creating visual calculations a breeze, demonstrated in the screenshot example:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-123.png)  \nOf course, the colored highlights between the formula bar and the visual matrix will match:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-124.png) If you still want to type or make more advanced changes you can do that still! Simply change the value and the parameter picker will disappear. As soon as you enter a valid value, the parameter picker will reappear.  \nNote that the parameter pickers right now are only available for required parameters on functions that are exclusive to visual calculations (and select other functions) that have a defined list of options. Required parameters that can take any text, or numerical value will not get a parameter picker, and neither will many DAX functions.  \n***Visual calculations are more resilient to changes in the visual***  \nIf you previously created a visual calculation with an axis reference, such as COLUMNS, and then changed visual types resulting in the absence of COLUMNS, the visual calculation would produce an error and the visual would return an error. Starting with this release, a reference to a non-existent axis is permissible and will be ignored.  \nAdditionally, if you write RUNNINGSUM([Sales Amount], COLUMNS) on a bar chart (which does not have a COLUMNS axis), the result will simply equal the value of Sales Amount:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-125.png)  \nWe often change visual types to find the best way to present your data. Visual calculations should now work without breaking due to invalid axis references, making them easier to use. For instance, here’s the same visual calculation on a card (which has no real axis):  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Picture1.png)  \nThe visual calculation did not produce an error, even though it referred to an axis that was not present. An axis that is not present is simply ignored.  \n***Easily create calculations in Explore***  \nThis month, we added visual calculations to [Explore](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/explore-data-service). With Explore, it’s easy to perform quick and powerful data analysis. Visual calculations do the same but for calculations, so bringing the two experiences together made a lot of sense and makes Explore even more effective. Once you have opened your data in Explore, you can create a visual calculation from either the matrix or the visual by selecting ‘New visual calculation’:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-127.png)  \nThis opens the visual calculations edit mode which should feel familiar to you. Here you can enter your visual calculation just like you are used to doing in reports. The same tools are available, including the highlights, templates and parameter pickers:  \n![A screenshot of a calculator AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-calculator-ai-generated-content-5.png)  \nAfter adding the visual calculation, the other visual will show the visual calculation as well (depending on the visual type):  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Picture2.png)  \nIf the other visual is unable to display data after the addition of the visual calculation, it will enter an error state. In such cases, you may either remove the visual calculation or modify the visual type.  \nVisual calculations in Explore make exploring data even easier and more powerful.",

        "title": "Sparklines (Generally Available)",
        "content": "### Sparklines (Generally Available)  \nSparklines are tiny charts shown within cells of a table or matrix that make it easy to see and compare trends quickly. They’ve been in preview since [December of 2021](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/power-bi-december-2021-feature-summary/#post-18168-_Toc89785231) and are now generally available! Also, we have added great new functionality for those who work with both sparklines and calculation groups together as you can now decide how a calculation group is applied to the sparkline. You can choose between ‘Individual values’ (default) or ‘Entire sparkline’.  \nFor new sparklines, calculation group selections will be applied to the individual values on the sparkline by default. If you change the setting to ‘Entire sparkline’, the calculation group will be evaluated over all the points on the sparkline. Existing sparklines will remain unchanged, and calculation group selections will continue to apply to the entire sparkline unless you change their configuration.  \nAn example of this in practice is a measure that calculates the Sum of Gross Sales by totaling the Gross Sales.  \n```\nSum of Gross Sales = SUM( financials[Gross Sales] )\n```  \nA measure called IsBigSales has been added, which compares the Sum of Gross Sales against a BigSalesSize cutoff value set to 1,000,000 using a field parameter.  \n```\nIsBigSales = IF ( 'financials'[Sum of Gross Sales] >= BigSalesSize[BigSalesSize Value], TRUE, FALSE )\n```  \nA calculation group was added that contains three calculation items:  \n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Calculation Item Name | Expression | Description |\n| Actual | Actual = SELECTEDMEASURE() | Show value always |\n| Actual For BigSales Only | Actual For Big Sales Only = IF( [IsBigSales], SELECTEDMEASURE(), BLANK() ) | Show value for big sales, otherwise return blank |\n| Percentage Of Grand Total | Percentage Of Grand Total = DIVIDE( SELECTEDMEASURE(), CALCULATE( SELECTEDMEASURE(), ALLSELECTED() ) ) | Returns the percentage of the grand total |  \nA matrix was created to display the sum of gross sales by product. Additionally, a sparkline was added to illustrate the sum of gross sales by month.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-128.png)  \nThe sparkline that shows Sum of Gross Sales by Month Number is set to the default behavior of applying the sparkline to Individual Values:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-129.png)  \nWhen switching the calculation group to ‘Actual for Big Sales Only’ using the slicer, it will evaluate **each value on the sparkline**. Therefore, it will display only values for months and brand combinations exceeding the 1,000,000 BigSalesSize cutoff. To enhance clarity, I have included a matrix that displays Gross Sales by Month and Product, utilizing conditional formatting to emphasize values above the cutoff. The highlighted values correspond with those on the sparkline:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-130.png)  \nLet’s set the sparkline to apply the calculation group to the entire sparkline. Now all sparklines appear because the calculation evaluates the total values without considering the X-axis (Month Number). Since each Product’s Gross Sales exceed the cutoff point, all sparklines display. If we raise the cutoff to 3,000,000, some sparklines will disappear. I added a matrix with conditional formatting below to illustrate this behavior:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-131.png)  \nThe Sum of Gross Sales exceeds the cutoff for almost all Products, except Carretera and Montana. Consequently, it’s not displayed in the matrix or as a sparkline for these products. Sparklines appear normally for other Product/Country combinations. ‘Show items with no data’ is enabled to display brands where the sparkline and Sum of Gross Sales return BLANK(); otherwise, those brands would be hidden.  \nIt is important to recognize that applying a calculation group item, which performs an arithmetic operation, to a sparkline set to ‘Apply to entire sparkline’ is not supported. To illustrate this, I will change the calculation group to Percent of Grand Total (which indeed performs an arithmetic operation using DIVIDE). As a result, the visual showing the sparkline will show an error and prompt you to set the sparkline to ‘Individual values’ to display it correctly again:  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Picture3.png)  \nPressing Convert or setting the sparkline to ‘Individual values’ again will make the visual show again:  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Picture4.png)  \nCalculation groups and sparklines are a powerful combination!

        "content": "### New Tenant Settings for Azure Maps Visual (Action Required)  \nWe’re excited to share an important update to the Azure Maps visual in Power BI that gives you greater control over data residency and governance, while also simplifying the experience for administrators.  \nHistorically, enabling Azure Maps required an admin opt-in due to reliance on third-party services for geocoding, which introduced compliance complexities around data leaving your tenant’s region. That’s now changing.  \n**What’s new?**  \nAfter work in recent years, the Power BI Azure Maps visual no longer requires sub processors for geocoding and guarantees EU and US customers’ data resides within the US and Europe geographic boundaries.  \nTo support a wider range of customer needs, we’re also introducing granular tenant settings that let you:  \n* Decide whether data can be processed outside your tenant’s geographic region.\n* Enable or disable the use of services (such as selection tools) that are supported by certified Microsoft Online Services sub processors.  \nThese changes offer increased flexibility for organizations with stringent data-handling requirements. These tenant switches are included in the June release.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Picture6.png)  \nThe state of the tenant settings, outlined in the table below, will be dependent on whether you’ve enabled the previous Azure Maps setting or not.  \n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| **Setting Name** | **Description** | **Default State** |\n| Users can use the Azure Maps visual. | When this setting is on, users will be able to create and view the Azure Map visual.

With this setting on, data sent to Azure Maps can be processed in a region where the service is available, which might be outside your tenant’s geographic region, compliance boundary, or national cloud instance. | Off by default, except for existing tenants that have turned Azure Maps on |\n| Data sent to Azure Maps can be processed by Microsoft Online Services Sub processors. | Some Azure Maps visual services, including the selection tool, may require mapping capabilities provided in part by Microsoft Online Services sub processors.This setting will control the availability of these features. | Off by default, except for existing tenants that have turned Azure Maps on |  \n**Required Actions**  \nTo support these new capabilities, your organization must be on the April release of Power BI Desktop or later. If you’re on an older version, the Azure Maps visual will no longer work in your reports.  \nAdditionally, customers outside the US and EU will need to explicitly enable a new tenant setting: Data sent to Azure Maps can be processed outside your tenant’s geographic region, compliance boundary or national cloud instance’ to allow Azure Maps mapping features to work as expected.

        "title": "DAX Functions and Capabilities",
        "content": "## DAX Functions and Capabilities  \n**Visual Calculations**  \nThe way you write DAX changes today with the introduction of visual calculations! Visual calculations are DAX calculations that are defined and executed directly on a visual. A visual calculation can refer to any data in the visual, including columns, measures, or other visual calculations. This approach removes the complexity of the semantic model and simplifies the process of writing DAX. You can use visual calculations to complete common business calculations such as running sums or moving averages. Visual calculations make it easy to do calculations that were previously very hard or even almost impossible to do.  \nTo learn more about how to enable and use visual calculations, visit [Visual calculations overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview)documentation.  \n**Value Filter Behavior**  \nWe are introducing a new option to control value filter behavior. By enabling the “Independent Value Filters” setting, users can prevent the automatic combining of multiple filters on the same table into a single coalesced filter. This change offers greater flexibility, allowing for more precise and independent filtering to meet specific modeling needs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and control of data queries. To set this property for SSAS, you can use the Tabular Object Model or [TMSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/analysis-services/tmsl/tabular-model-scripting-language-tmsl-reference) based on the [ValueFilterBehavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices.tabular.model.valuefilterbehavior) property.  \nFor more details, refer to the[Value filter behavior](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/value-filter-behavior)documentation.  \n**Selection Expressions for Calculation Groups**  \nSelection expressions allow fine-tuned control over how calculations behave when certain conditions are met. They introduce additional logic for handling cases where multiple calculation items are selected or when no specific selection is made on a calculation group.  \nFor more details, refer to the[Calculations groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/analysis-services/tabular-models/calculation-groups#selection-expressions)documentation.  \n**DAX Functions Improvements**  \nSSAS 2025 includes support for multiple new DAX functions and improvements including:  \n* **LINEST and LINESTX**: These two functions perform linear regression, leveraging the Least Squares method, to calculate a straight line that best fits the given data and return a table describing that line. These functions are especially useful in predicting unknown values (Y) given known values (X).\n+ For more details, refer to the: [LINEST DAX function](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/linest-function-dax) and [LINESTX DAX function](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/linestx-function-dax)documentation.\n* **INFO Functions**: The existing TMSCHEMA DMVs are now available as a new family of DAX functions, which allows querying metadata about semantic models directly within DAX, offering integration with other DAX functions for enhanced diagnostics and analysis.\n+ For more details, visit: [Info DAX functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/info-functions-dax)documentation.\n* **APPROXIMATEDISTINCTCOUNT**: This function is currently available for DirectQuery mode and returns an estimated count of unique values in a column by invoking a corresponding aggregation operation in the data source, which is optimized for query performance.\n+ For more details, visit [Approximatedistinctcount DAX function](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/approximate-distinctcount-function-dax), which lists supported data sources.\n* **Window Functions**: This function retrieves a slice of results using absolute or relative positioning. The WINDOW function will make it easier to perform calculations such as adding a running total, moving average or similar calculations that rely on selecting a range of values. It also comes with two helper functions called ORDERBY and PARTITIONBY.\n+ For more details, refer to the[Window DAX function](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/window-function-dax)documentation.\n* **MINX/MAXX:** We have added an optional variant parameter to MINX and MAXX DAX functions. Traditionally, these functions ignore text and Boolean values when there are variants or mixed data types, such as text and numeric. Now with the new optional variant parameter set to TRUE, the functions will consider the text values.\n+ For more details, visit [MINX DAX function](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/minx-function-dax) and [MAXX DAX function](https://learn.microsoft.com/dax/maxx-function-dax).",

Suddenly, patterns appear. Decisions make more sense. And you become the go-to person for insight, not just intuition.  \nStarting on June 11, the new[PL-300 livestreamseries](https://aka.ms/pl300/live)takes away the jargon and gives you real, digestible content in a live format with actual experts you can talk to! Not pre-recorded monologues. Not click-through modules. Real voices, real demos, real-time learning.  \nIt’s not a lecture but a conversation. It’s a virtual meet-up where beginners, dabblers, and pros all get together to learn, laugh, and level up. And it just so happens that you walk away more confident, capable, and maybe even ready to ace a Microsoft certification exam.  \n[![Live sessions for exam PL-300 June 11 - July 9th, at 8am or 7pm Pacific. Register at https://aka.ms/pl300/live](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/image/serverpage/image-id/1272942i62B709464C1F3DBB/image-size/large?v=v2&px=999 \"Sahir Maharaj - Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst.png\")](https://aka.ms/pl300/live)  \nLive sessions for exam PL-300 June 11 – July 9th, at 8am or 7pm Pacific. Register at https://aka.ms/pl300/live.  \n**What’s in it for you?**  \nWe’re all juggling a lot, and blocking out an hour a week can feel like a big ask. Here’s three solid reasons why you should join the PL-300 livestream series:  \n**1. You’ll stop “Googling it” and start*getting it***  \nWe’ve all fallen into that trap of bouncing from one YouTube tutorial to another, hoping one of them finally explains what a data model actually is. These sessions cut through that noise. Each one is structured, sequential, and delivered by experts who actually know how to explain things in a way that makes sense.  \nYou’ll walk away from each session with concepts that stick. You’ll learn why things work the way they do in Power BI, so you’re not just passing a test but building skills that translate to your work.  \n**2. It’s a certification that actually boosts your career**  \nHaving ‘Power BI Data Analyst Certified’ (PL-300) on your resume doesn’t just make you stand out but shows you’re committed, current, and capable. It tells employers you’re not just clicking around in dashboards, you understand the logic, the flow, and the strategy behind data storytelling.  \nThis kind of recognition isn’t just about getting hired. It’s about career confidence. Whether you’re trying to land that next role, get promoted, or just feel more in control of your day-to-day work, this certification gives you leverage. It says, “I’ve got this,” in a world where most people are still winging it with spreadsheets.  \n**3. Community makes everything better**  \nThe Power BI community is wildly supportive. It’s curious, motivated people coming together from all over the world, asking questions, sharing tips, and encouraging each other. There’s something powerful about knowing you’re not alone in trying to figure this stuff out.  \n**How is the series structured?**  \nIt’s five manageable sessions, each with its own focus, vibe, instructors and moderators. You’ll start with the basics – how to prep data, clean it, and get it ready for analysis.  \nNext, you’ll learn how to model data (which sounds complex), but it’s really just about making your data more useful and less chaotic. This is where DAX comes in. It can seem daunting at first, but once you see it in action, it clicks.  \nAnd from there, the magic happens. You’ll explore visualizations and storytelling with data (arguably the most fun part). If you’ve ever looked at a wall of numbers and wished it could just tell you what to do, this session will be your favorite.  \nBy the fourth session, you’ll be ready to handle the less glamorous but super important stuff: security and data governance. Going beyond passwords and policies, it’s about structuring access, managing workspaces, and ensuring your data insights are shared safely and effectively.  \nAnd finally, the last session is all about prepping for exam day. This is where everything comes together. There’s open Q&A, study tips, and a chance to ask the presenters anything that’s been confusing you. The vibe here is less “cram session” and more “team huddle.”  \n**Ready to register?**  \nThe series runs weekly from June 11 – July 9, with sessions goinglive at 8am PT and 7pm PT.  \nIf you miss a session, they are all recorded and available on demand within 48 hours of the live session.  \nRegister for the series at[https://aka.ms/pl300/live.](https://aka.ms/pl300/live)",

To help you unlock the full potential of AI, we’re excited to announce the preview of new capabilities designed to help you prepare your data to work better with Copilot.  \nThree essential capabilities to assist in preparing your semantic models for AI are available in preview.  \n* **AI Data Schema**: select a curated subset of your model’s schema for Copilot to use in its responses. By narrowing the scope to only the most relevant fields, you help Copilot reason more effectively and deliver more accurate results.\n* **Verified answers**: curate verified, visual answers directly from your report to guide Copilot to respond with confidence to the most frequently asked questions. This helps ensure consistency and trust in how Copilot answers your users’ questions.\n* **AI instructions**: add contextual details, business logic, and interpretation guidelines directly into Copilot prompts. This helps tailor Copilot’s responses to align with your organization’s specific needs.  \nNow, you’ll see a new **Prep data for AI** button in the ribbon, right next to the familiar Copilot button. Clicking opens a new dialog with three powerful tools to help you get started:  \n![Picture 1653357590, Picture](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture-1653357590-picture-1.png)  \nAfter selecting this button, you’ll be taken to a dialog with three key features to get you started.  \n![Picture](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture-15.png)  \n**Notes:**  \n* All prep data for AI features are saved at the semantic model level.\n* Prep data for AI features work best with models in import mode.\n* You must have written permission on the model to use these capabilities.\n* We recommend using import mode. Composite and DirectQuery have limitations. DirectLake is not yet supported.  \n**Power BI Desktop:** after preparing your data, test the impact directly in the Copilot pane. (Tip: You may need to refresh or reopen the pane to see updates.)  \n**Power BI Service (including Standalone Copilot):** once your report is published, users will benefit from your data prep efforts immediately in their Copilot experiences. Be sure to mark your semantic model as prepped for AI!  \nabout preparing your data for AI.",

The semantic models we know, and love are optimized for Power BI Reporting, which means they often contain fields that don’t necessarily need to be considered for Copilot responses. AI Data Schema allows semantic model authors to select a subset of the semantic model’s schema as the AI Data Schema for Copilot to reason over in its responses. By selecting only the most important fields, you help Copilot focus on what matters—improving the relevance, clarity, and accuracy of its responses. It’s a simple way to guide AI behavior without having to restructure your entire model.  \nGetting started with AI Data Schema:  \nSimplify your data schema for Copilot through the **Prep data for AI** button in the Desktop ribbon.  \nTo configure your AI data schema, choose the tables, columns, measures, and hierarchies for Copilot’s use. Confirm your selections and close the dialog.  \n![Picture](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture-16.png)",

Each Verified Answer pairs a predefined trigger phrase with a specific visual from your report—both stored directly in the semantic model.  \nBy guiding Copilot to respond with trusted, pre-defined answers, you help ensure users get consistent, accurate information—especially for high-impact or frequently asked questions.  \nThere are two primary goals of Verified Answers:  \n1. **Improve Response Accuracy** – Surface curated visuals and content to deliver more precise, context-aware answers—especially for nuanced or frequently asked questions.\n2. **Enhance Copilot Intelligence** – Teach Copilot what a ‘good’ answer looks like by linking specific questions or keywords to trusted responses.

Once configured, the associated visual will be returned when a user enters a matching or similar phrase into a Copilot chat.  \n![Picture](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture-18.png)  \nYou can also include filters to ensure that filtered data is reflected in the Verified Answer. This allows users to receive accurate, filtered responses without requiring authors to manually define variations of trigger phrases for each filter state.  \n![Picture](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture-19.png)  \nTo manage your verified answers, access the dialog via **Prep data for AI.** From here, you can see your verified answers, add additional trigger phrases, and delete any verified answers that no longer apply.  \n![Picture](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture-20.png)  \nFor limitations and best practices, refer to the [documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-prepare-data-ai-verified-answers#considerations-and-limitations).  \n![Picture](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture-21.png)",

However, as much as you all like them, there are a couple of recurring pieces of feedback. One of them has to do with how changes in the field selected by the field parameter resets the sorting of a visual. This month we are resolving this by persisting in the sorting even if you change the field selected by the field parameter!  \nFor instance, a visual can use a field parameter to display Total Sales based on the selected field. In this example, the selected field is Category.  \nNotice that I sorted the visual by Category ascending:  \n![A graph with blue bars AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-graph-with-blue-bars-ai-generated-content-may-b-1.png)  \nNow let’s switch the field parameter to Class instead of Category and contrast old and new behavior:  \n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Previous (Before May 2025)** | **New (Starting May 2025)** |\n| A graph of sales AI-generated content may be incorrect. | A graph of a number of different types of sales AI-generated content may be incorrect. |  \nAs soon as you switch the field selected by the field parameter to something else (in our example Class), the sort order of the visual would change and your visual would be sorted by Total Sales descending (which is the default sort order for this type of visual). Starting this month, that is no longer the case, and the sort order will persist and the visual is still sorted by the field selected by the field parameter even after it is switched.  \nThis is one of the key improvements to field parameters. More updates will follow soon! Learn more about [field parameters](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/power-bi-field-parameters) in the documentation.",

Visual calculations simplify DAX by focusing on one visual at a time, allowing for easy creation of powerful calculations and verification of your work.  \nThe new LOOKUP and LOOKUPWITHTOTALS functions enable retrieval of values from the visual matrix through absolute navigation with one or more filters applied. Although both functions serve similar purposes, they differ in handling omitted filters.  \nConsider a visual that shows the Sales per product Category and Class. In this visual we will add the following visual calculations:  \nLOOKUPExample = LOOKUP( AVERAGE( [Sales Amount] ), [Class], “H” )  \nLOOKUPWITHTOTALSExample = LOOKUPWITHTOTALS( AVERAGE( [Sales Amount] ), [Class], ”H” )  \n![A table displaying sales data categorized by product category and subcategory, alongside two example columns labeled “LOOKUPExample” and “LOOKUPWITHTOTALSExample.” The categories include Accessories, Bikes, Clothing, and Components, each with subcategories labeled H, L, and M.

Since we didn’t specify a filter for Category, the **LOOKUPWITHTOTALSExample** visual calculation returns average Sales for the products in the H class across all categories. This is the same value returned by the **LOOKUPExample** on the Total row.  \nTo make things even easier, we have also added templates for both LOOKUP and LOOKUPWITHTOTALS:  \n![A screenshot of the templates dropdown in the visual calculations edit mode in Power BI.

This update allows for even more control over how the slicer both looks and functions, allowing you to create almost any list slicer design you can think of.  \nFirst up, this month you can now restrict selection in the slicer to only the last level (leaf nodes) when using a hierarchy with the slicer. This means that users can only select the most specific items within the list. To use this option, just select the **Restrict to leaf nodes** option with the Selection card of the formatting pane. Once selected, selecting any of the higher nodes of the slicer will always expand/collapse the level instead of selecting it.  \n![A screenshot of a menu AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-menu-ai-generated-content-may-b-1.png)  \nNext are two new slicer formatting options: Label and Images.  \n**Label** allows you to add a secondary row to each value in the slicer to provide additional information, whether that be a subtitle or an additional metric. You can find Label as a section of the Callout values card. You have similar formatting options to the values themselves.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-46.png)  \nThe new **Images** card lets you add just that, images, to your slicer. You can add a unique image from your model to go along with each value of your slicer and control some basic formatting for that image including (but not limited to) image fit, transparency, saturation, and position.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-47.png)  \nThe method for controlling the formatting of the various states of the slicer has been thoroughly revised. Previously, you were limited to Default, Hover, Press, Selected, and Mixed as your states, and the formatting was always shared across all fields within the hierarchy.  \nNow you can format each field of your hierarchy separately using the **Series** dropdown of the Apply settings to card.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-48.png)  \nFor each of those, you’ll have control over a subset of the following states: All, Rest, Hover, Press, Selected, and Mixed. We have updated the dropdown to conditionally show only the states that are most commonly applicable for that card’s component, so for example you won’t see Mixed as an Option for the Expand/collapse icon.  \nAdditionally, we have an Advanced toggle that breaks down the states you can configure into **Selection, Expansion, and Interaction States**.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-49.png)  \nThe breakdown of what’s formattable in each of these is as follows:  \n* Selection state – All, Selected, Unselected, Mixed\n* Expansion state – All, Expanded, Collapsed\n* Interaction state – All, Hover, Press, Rest, Disabled  \nThis allows you to get incredibly precise about the formatting for every possible state of individual values of the slicer, and remember, you can do this separately for each level of the hierarchy if you want to. You have these new state controls for the Callout values, Images, Selection icon, Expand/collapse icon, and Buttons cards.",

Don’t wait—upgrade now to be ready for the enhanced governance controls and avoid disruptions.  \nAlso starting with the June release, you may notice changes in the ordering of map layers in the Azure Maps visual. This update resolves several known issues that previously affected the correct rendering sequence of layers, which results in layers and their associated labels occasionally overlapping in unexpected ways. The updated behavior may impact the appearance of your reports, specifically when you have multiple layers visible at the same time. You can customize the layer order using the ‘Layer position’ setting available for each layer.",

Simply adding a data column and summing it in a visual is called creating an **implicit measure** and when this property is enabled, adding implicit measures does not work. This includes in the values and tooltip sections, as well as in conditional formatting sections on visuals. For example, actions such as adding a data column to a card visual to show the first, last, or sum of it do not work with this property enabled. Report authors can create a measure or use a visual calculation on the visual to visualize this aggregated data instead.  \nLearn more about [creating measures](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-measures) or [creating visual calculations](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview).  \nIf an implicit measure was already created in a visual, on the visual itself or in conditional formatting, they will still work with discourage implicit measure now enabled.

Even when a calculation group is removed, the property stays enabled until the model author disables it. The property can also be enabled without a calculation group present.

It doesn’t stop there though, because this month, we are wrapping up our preview of selection expressions!  \nSelection expressions allow fine-tuned control over how calculations behave when certain conditions are met. They introduce additional logic for handling cases where multiple calculation items are selected or when no specific selection is made on a calculation group. This provides a way to do better error handling but also opens interesting scenarios that provide some good default behavior, for example, automatic currency conversion. Selection expressions are optionally defined on a calculation group and consist of an expression as well as an optional dynamic format expression.  \nThere are two types of selection expressions:  \n* **multipleOrEmptySelectionExpression** – This selection expression is applied when:\n+ multiple calculation items have been selected,\n+ a non-existing calculation item has been selected, or\n+ a conflicting selection has been made.\n* **noSelectionExpression** – This selection expression is applied when the calculation group is not filtered.  \nAdditionally, using the new **selectionExpressionBehavior** setting on the semantic model, you can decide how calculations are evaluated for (sub)totals and what they return if no selection expressions are defined yet the user makes selections on the calculation group that would have triggered the evaluation of the selection expressions.  \nLearn more about [selection expressions](https://learn.microsoft.com/analysis-services/tabular-models/calculation-groups?view=asallproducts-allversions#selection-expressions) in our documentation.",

The TMDL view now also upgrades the compatibility level automatically when utilizing a feature that necessitates this upgrade. This functionality is particularly beneficial when copying scripts from other semantic models that may operate at a higher compatibility level.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogs.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-63.png)  \nRenaming Columns with TMDL View  \nRenaming columns in TMDL view was previously possible, but the old names would return after a Refresh. After renaming the TMDL view, a Power Query rename step had to be added:\n![A screen shot of a computer code AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogs.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screen-shot-of-a-computer-code-ai-generated-con-1.png)  \nThis requirement has been removed, and it is now possible to rename your columns using TMDL view or external tools without updating the Power Query expression. This can be very useful for scenarios involving bulk renaming of columns. For instance, if there is a need to remove spaces from all columns, the following RegEx find and replace can be utilized:  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogs.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-64.png)  \nAfter performing a find and replace and applying the changes, the column name will differ from the sourceColumn. In this state, Power BI Desktop will maintain this change and stop synchronizing the column names of your semantic model with those in Power Query. The connection between the semantic model columns and the query columns is determined solely by the sourceColumn property.  \n![A screen shot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogs.azurewebsites.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screen-shot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-1.png)  \nColumns with different names from sourceColumn will no longer have automatic Power Query steps added.",

By combining smart sizing and color, the size of each dot directly represents the magnitude of the variance, making it easy to identify areas of over- or underperformance. Action dots are a compact yet powerful addition to data visualization, offering a clear, responsive, and scalable way to represent relative variances. By saving space and simplifying comparisons, this visual type enhances the speed and accuracy of business insights, making it a valuable feature for any data-driven professional.  \nWe’ve also brought back **ragged hierarchies**—a feature originally available in Zebra BI Tables but temporarily unavailable after the 6.0 release. With clean hierarchy consolidation and improved DirectQuery performance, you can now manage multi-level reports seamlessly, eliminating duplication issues and reducing load times.

You know you’ve seen it before, you know the general topic, maybe you even remember the name of the visual you’re trying to hunt down. But you cannot seem to remember the name of the report or what workspace you saw it in.  \nThat’s where the new standalone Copilot experience comes in. You can ask Copilot to find reports, semantic models, apps, and data agents that you have access to. We’ll match across many different factors to quickly find the most relevant items.  \nMetadata, such as the item’s name, description, content (such as, visual titles or textboxes), and the workspace name, are the most important properties used. However, we’ll also consider other attributes such as how recently you viewed it, if it was endorsed, if it’s in your Favorites, and its popularity within your tenant.  \n![Search results in the standalone Copilot experience for the prompt \"Find items about sales revenue\"](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m.png)  \nWe’ll return a hyperlinked list of relevant items with all the details you need to pick which is the one you were looking for.",

        "content": "## Key insights only a question away  \nThe standalone Copilot experience doesn’t just find content for you though. It can also help you answer new ad hoc questions and find new insights.  \nUsing Copilot’s summary capabilities allows you to quickly identify the most interesting data within your report. Often, reports can become quite complex, and you can easily spend 30 minutes to a couple of hours combing through all the details. However, Copilot can help you sift through the report, giving you easy to digest overviews of your data. Just ask Copilot to ‘Tell me about trends in sales’ or more specific topics, like ‘What should I know about bike sales in Washington?’.  \n![A Copilot summary of a report highlighting interesting sales trends and using two visuals from the report](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-1.png)  \nCopilot will respond with a detailed summary of your report and nest the most relevant visuals right in the reply. These visuals link back to their place in the report but can also be explored so you can dive deeper – applying your own filters or changing the layout.  \nYou may also have a business question that cannot be answered by the existing report. Typically, what you’d have to do in these cases is work with an analyst to get a new visual added to the report, which can take time, delaying your ability to make a data driven decision. This can be especially cumbersome if it’s not something you’d want to track long term.  \nWith the standalone Copilot experience, you can easily ask questions on the semantic model, allowing you to quickly find answers to ad hoc questions and allowing your analysts to focus on critical business requirements.  \nAll you need to do is ask the question and you’ll get a new visual created with the answer. If you know what report or model the right data has, for best results, you can attach it to the chat.  \n![Copilot using a data question, \"What's my sales for each store?\", with a bar chart.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-2.png)  \nBut even if you don’t, Copilot can still help. Just ask your question and Copilot will first find the most likely item you’d want to reference, ask you to confirm which one you’d like to use, and then return the result. You can also ask follow-up questions based on what you’ve already asked in the chat session.  \n![User asked Copilot \"What's my sales for each menu category at my pizza places?\". Copilot suggested 3 reports. The user picked one and Copilot provided an answer as a bar chart.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/word-image-29783-5.png)  \nDepending on the type of question you ask, if it’s not in the model already, but could be derived from it, Copilot can also generate DAX queries to answer questions that require ad hoc calculations. For example, you could ask what the year-over-year growth for sales was, or the ratio of a particular category of products to all products.  \nAnd of course, just as with the Copilot pane, you can explore your visuals further using our Explore experience, allowing you to seamlessly transition between using chat and traditional drag and drop UI to explore your data.  \n![Using the Explore feature which lets you change the fields, chart type, and add filters.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-3.png)  \nYou can also ask questions against your Fabric data agents. Data agents are AI-powered data assistants that can help determine when to use specific data, how to combine it, and what insights matter most.With data agents, you can also fine-tune results based on your organization-specific instructions, examples and guidance so you can answer data questions based on your data stored in Microsoft OneLake. Just attach the data agent along with your question and you’ll get your answer right in-line.

        "content": "## High quality, understandable answers  \nOur goal is that month after month, you’ll see improvements in the quality of the answers you get back from Copilot. For example, in March we made [a huge improvement to the language understanding layer](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/power-bi-march-2025-feature-summary/#post-29214-_Toc193819886), enabling Copilot to understand more of your questions out of the box. In particular, Copilot got much better at understanding common synonyms (ex. tea is a synonym for chai), phrasings (what ‘export’ means in the context of suppliers), and individual values in your model.  \nWe’re taking that a step further this month by improving Copilot’s ability to handle relative dates and to generate date related filters.  \n|  |  |  |\n| --- | --- | --- |\n| Relative dates by month | Partial dates like ‘March’ uses the current year even if not specified ‘March 2025’ | Relative dates by day of the week |\n| Copilot correctly answering \"sales for helmets over the last 3 months. show each month\" | Copilot understanding that when the user asked for 'sales for France in March' that they likely mean March of this year. | Copilot giving the correct answer to the question 'sales from france last tuesday' |  \nYou’ll also notice that in this standalone Copilot experience, the visual answers you’re getting back have a style applied to them. This new styling is meant to make the visual cleaner and help with the readability of the answer.  \n![A clustered column chart showing off the new theme styles](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-graph-ai-generated-content-may.png)",

        "title": "Simplified data prep for AI",
        "content": "## Simplified data prep for AI  \nTo unlock the full potential of AI, you need to consider the quality of your semantic model. Your data is the foundation upon which consumers will be getting their insights, and the clearer, more structured, and context rich your data is, the better the answers consumers will get. But we also know it can be hard to understand how to influence the quality of Copilot’s answers and test the results. With that in mind, we’re also excited to announce a suite of Copilot tooling features all around preparing your data for AI.  \n![The prep data for AI button in the Power BI Desktop ribbon](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-6.png)  \nYou can easily reach these Prep data for AI features right in the ribbon in Power BI Desktop, and from here, you can easily see the three primary features we’re launching: AI data schema, verified answers and AI instructions.  \n![The Prep data for AI dialog in Power BI Desktop](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-7.png)  \nWe recommend starting by simplifying your data schema. Most semantic models out there today are optimized with reporting in mind, and what works best for reporting isn’t always what’s best for AI. For example, you may have measures that are specifically designed to work in the context of a single visual on the report, or you could have many versions of the same measure with different filter context such as ‘sales’, ‘sales in 2015’, and ‘sales last period’. Often, these fields don’t need to be considered for Copilot responses.  \nUsing the Simplify the data schema option, you can easily uncheck fields, hiding them from Copilot, which in turn, improves the relevance, clarity and accuracy of Copilot-generated responses.  \n![Using the option to simplify the data schema option in the Prep data for AI dialog.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture.png)  \nAfter simplifying the AI data schema, we recommend creating verified answers: curated responses that are automatically triggered when users input predefined phrases in Copilot chat experiences. You’ve not only invested time in building up your semantic models, but also building out very detailed reports based on your business needs. Often you already have a visual that answers the most frequently asked questions, but users can’t always find it easily. Verified answers helps solve this. Just mark that visual as an answer to the question, and Copilot will reference it going forward.  \nVerified answers help improve the quality of Copilot through two ways:  \n1. **Improve response accuracy –** Surface curated visuals and content to deliver more precise, context-aware answers—especially for nuanced or frequently asked questions.\n2. **Enhance Copilot intelligence –** Teach Copilot what a ‘good’ answer looks like by linking specific questions or keywords to trusted responses. Over time, this helps Copilot respond more intelligently to similar prompts.  \nTo get started, just open the ellipsis menu of the visual you want Copilot to use, and pick the **Set up a verified answer** option.  \n![You can access the Set up verified answer option in the visual's menu \"...\"](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-graph-of-different-colored-lines-ai-generated-c.png)  \nThis launches the setup dialog where you can define trigger phrases, keywords, or full questions that users are likely to ask. Once configured, the associated visual will be returned when a user enters a matching or similar phrase into a Copilot chat. You can also include filters to ensure that users can get filtered versions of the visual in responses.  \n![The verified answers configuration option in the Prep data for AI dialog.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-8.png)  \nAdditionally, you can manage existing verified answers from the Prep data for AI dialog.  \n![Viewing the full list of verified answers already configured for a model.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture-1.png)  \nThe third feature is adding AI instructions. AI instructions enable you to enhance Copilot’s capabilities by connecting it to your organization’s knowledge. By providing Copilot with key business context, guidance, and domain-specific logic, you can help Copilot understand your business’ specific context and provide more relevant, accurate responses. Whether it’s defining busy seasons, defining how metrics should be interpreted, or excluding irrelevant data, AI Instructions allow you to shape how Copilot understands and interacts with your data, resulting in more tailored insights and greater confidence across Copilot outputs.  \nAll you need to do is go to the Add AI instructions section of the Prep data for AI dialog, add the instructions, and hit apply.  \n![Using the AI instructions option of the Prep data for AI dialog.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/picture-2.png)  \nOf course, as you work through using these various tooling features to improve the quality of Copilot for consumers, you will want to test how changes impact the quality of the results. This can be quite an iterative process, and you’ll likely want to jump between testing key questions and the tooling dialog to make adjustments. To give you a little more flexibility while going through the testing process, we’ve introduced a skill picker in the Copilot pane in Power BI Desktop.  \nThis skill picker allows you to focus just on the specific subset of Copilot capabilities you’re working on currently. For example, if you’re trying to reduce the data schema to improve the quality of results when Copilot generates visuals off the semantic model, you may want set the skill picker to just answer questions about the data, so you don’t need to work about Copilot trying to generate a report page based on your questions.  \nThe skill picker includes three capabilities currently, which can be swapped between using the ‘select skills’ option in the area you type your prompt:  \n* **Answer questions about the data**\nLeverages Copilot to respond to questions based on a given semantic model.\n* **Analyze report visuals**\nEnables Copilot to interpret and answer questions about the visuals within a report.\n* **Create new report pages**",

It doesn’t stop there though; selection expressions offer even more fine-tuned control.  \nSelection Expressions allow fine-tuned control over how calculations behave when certain conditions are met. They introduce additional logic for handling cases where multiple calculation items are selected or when no specific selection is made on a calculation group. This provides a way to do better error handling but also opens interesting scenarios that provide some good default behavior, for example, automatic currency conversion. Selection expressions are optionally defined on a calculation group and consist of an expression as well as an optional dynamic format expression.",

        "content": "## Reason for unification  \nAlthough customers appreciate datamarts providing a simpler way to get SQL experiences for analytics, there’s worry about scale, performance, and going ‘all in’ because there’s no grow-up story. With the advent of Microsoft Fabric, you don’t have to choose between a Power BI Datamart or a full-blown data warehouse. Fabric data warehouse is the natural evolution of Power BI datamarts, built on next generation analytics technology and for the era of AI from Microsoft evolved from Azure Synapse Analytics and SQL Server.  \nAs Fabric Data Warehouse is generally available (GA), it provides enterprise-ready benefits beyond those of datamarts including:  \n* **DDL/DML support:** Create and manage SQL objects with DML/DDL support and multi-table transaction guarantees.\n* **Increased scalability**: While datamarts are limited to 100GB, Fabric Data Warehouses can handle any data size with fast query execution and optimization.\n* **Open data format:** All files stored as Delta/Parquet for cross engine interoperability enabling collaboration with business analysts and data scientists.\n* **AI integration:** Built with AI from the ground up, the SQL engine is AI powered to offer the best query performance with no tuning required along with Copilot to simplify SQL development.\n* **Rich SQL security:** Granular level security at the object, row, column levels are provided to help you ensure the right users have granular access.\n* **Cross-database queries:** Query data across multiple databases within the same Fabric workspaces including Fabric data warehouses and SQL analytics endpoints.\n* **Elevated developer experience:** You can ingest data to warehouse using multiple ways like data pipelines, dataflows and native high throughput Copy into statement. Along with this, rich intellisense, and TSQL notebook experience elevates experience to develop and consume data from warehouse.\n* **Source control capabilities**: Deployment pipelines, Git integration, and SQL projects are all supported to improve the efficiency of your development collaboration.\n* **Integration with Fabric**: Leverage other Fabric services for data science, analytics, or AI scenarios such as Fabric ML.\n* **Flexible licensing**: Fabric Data warehouse is supported as part of your Power BI Premium Capacity subscription (P SKU), or as Fabric capacity (F SKU with pay-as-you-go or reservation model) starting at $0.36 per hour. Free 60-day trials are available to help you get started too.\n* **Direct lake model**: Supports Power BI Direct Lake mode on tables which decreases the amount of time needed for a semantic model refresh and removes need for duplicate sets of data.\n* **Data recovery:** Capabilities to clone tables and restore a warehouse to a prior point-in-time in event of accidental corruption or data loss.",

        "content": "### Existing datamarts  \nStarting the first week of Nov 2025, Power BI datamarts will not be accessible from workspaces. To avoid losing your data and breaking reports built on top of datamarts, migrate your datamart to warehouse. Before starting the migration process, you can use the following tools to get a list of your datamarts:  \n* [Admin Monitoring workspace – Feature Usage and Adoption report](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/admin/feature-usage-adoption)\n* [Purview Hub](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/governance/use-microsoft-purview-hub?tabs=admin-view)\n* [Power BI admin portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/datamarts/datamarts-administration)\n* [Power BI REST APIs](https://learn.microsoft.com/rest/api/power-bi/admin)  \nThe following options describe how to manually migrate your existing datamarts to a Fabric Data Warehouse.  \n**Option 1:** Use the [accelerator scripts](https://github.com/microsoft/fabric-toolbox/tree/main/accelerators/power-bi-to-fabric-data-warehouse-modernization) to migrate your datamart to warehouse.  \n**Option 2:** Use manual steps to migrate your datamart to warehouse as below.  \n1. Navigate to your Datamart, click on **Transform data** in the ribbon, then **Export template** to export your Power BI datamart schema and data as a template in Power Query Online.![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/word-image-29722-2.png)\n2. Create a Fabric warehouse from the Fabric portal.\n3. From the Home tab of the warehouse, select the **Get data** option and then **New Dataflow Gen2**. Important: Creating a new dataflow gen2 through the warehouse will set each query’s destination to the current warehouse as the [default destination](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/default-destination), this can ultimately save you time by avoiding having to configure the destination for each query. You can also update or adjust these options including writing to different locations or changing the update method.![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica.png)\n4. Within the new dataflow gen2 editor, select **Import from a Power Query Template** located in the center of the empty editor.![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-1.png)\n5. Select the **s****ave & run** option, which will both publish your dataflow and start a refresh of your data loaded into the Fabric Data Warehouse.\n6. Connect your Power BI reports and dashboards to your Fabric Data Warehouse via the Default Semantic Model or as a data source.",

        "title": "Additional considerations",
        "content": "## Additional considerations  \nIn this section, you’ll learn on how to optimize your datamart for Fabric Data Warehouse. Although these are optional, they may be helpful depending on what type of datamart features your organization is leveraging.  \n* **Enable the Custom Semantic Modelin your Fabric Data Warehouse**  \nDatamarts automatically add all tables to the default Power BI semantic model. In Fabric Data Warehouse, based on customer feedback, we have modified the default behavior to not automatically add tables and views to the default Power BI semantic model. This change will ensure the background sync will not get triggered. This will also disable some actions like ‘New Measure’, ‘Create Report’, ‘Analyze in Excel’.  \nIf you want to change this default behavior, you can:  \n* Manually enable the **Sync the default Power BI semantic model** setting for each data warehouse or SQL analytics endpoint in the workspace. This will restart the background sync that will incur some [consumption costs](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/onelake/onelake-consumption).  \n![Screenshot from the Fabric portal showing the setting Sync the default Power BI semantic model is enabled.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/screenshot-from-the-fabric-portal-showing-the-sett.png)  \n* Manually pick tables and views to be added to semantic model through **Manage default Power BI semantic model** in the ribbon or info bar.  \n![Screenshot from the Fabric portal showing the default Manage the semantic model page, and the ability to manually pick more tables.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/05/screenshot-from-the-fabric-portal-showing-the-defa.png)  \nFrom here, you can then recreate any measures, relationships, or other business semantics as needed.  \nTo learn more on how to edit data models in the Power BI service, refer to, [Edit Data Models](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/service-edit-data-models)documentation.  \nAlternatively, you can script out the definitions and reapply to a new dataset programmatically. To first script out the default semantic model, you can use[SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](https://learn.microsoft.com/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms).  \nView the Tabular Model Scripting Language (TMSL) schema of the semantic model by scripting it out via the Object Explorer in SSMS. To connect, use the semantic model’s connection string, which looks likepowerbi://api.powerbi.com/v1.0/myorg/username. You can find the connection string for your semantic model in the**Settings**, under**Server settings**. From there, you can generate an XMLA script of the semantic model via SSMS’s**Script**context menu action. For more information, see[Dataset connectivity with the XMLA endpoint](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/enterprise/service-premium-connect-tools#connect-with-ssms).  \n* **Script out any row-level security (RLS) and reapply as needed**  \nFabric Data Warehouse supports more security and governance controls than Power BI datamarts at a granular level. Every object in datamarts is accessible via a view in the Model Schema. You can easily create a new Schema called Model, add Views from the tables, and then provide SQL security there, or provide any custom T-SQL security needs as required, going far beyond the GUI of the datamart.  \nLearn More  \n[Security for data warehousing in Microsoft Fabric](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/security)  \n[Row-level security in Fabric data warehousing](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-warehouse/row-level-security)  \n* **Incremental refresh with dataflows Gen 2**  \nIncremental refresh is a feature that allows you to refresh only the data that has changed since the last refresh, instead of refreshing the entire data. This can improve the performance and efficiency of your dataflows and reduce the load on your sources and destinations. For guidance on how to set up incremental refresh with Dataflow Gen2, refer to the[Pattern to incrementally amass data with Dataflow Gen2](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/data-factory/tutorial-setup-incremental-refresh-with-dataflows-gen2)documentation.",

This feature allows you to easily create mobile-optimized layouts for any new or existing report page, saving you time.  \nWhen you switch to the [mobile layout view in Power BI Desktop](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/power-bi-create-mobile-optimized-report-mobile-layout-view?tabs=powerbi-desktop), if the mobile canvas is empty, you can generate a mobile layout just by selecting the **Auto-create** button.  \nThe auto-create engine understands the desktop layout of your report and builds a mobile layout that considers the position, size, type, and order of the visuals that the report contains. It places both visible and hidden visuals, so if you have bookmarks that change a visual’s visibility, they will work in the automatically created mobile layout as well.  \nYou can edit the automatically created mobile layout, so if the result is not exactly what you expected, you can tweak it to make it perfect for your needs. Think of it as a starting point you can use to shorten the way to that beautiful, effective, mobile-optimized report you envision.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m.png)  \nTo learn more about Mobile layout auto-create, check out the[Automatic mobile layout creation](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/power-bi-create-mobile-optimized-report-mobile-layout-view#automatic-mobile-layout-creation) documentation.

Data Analysis Expressions, or DAX, is the key to accessing and analyzing data in a semantic model. Previously, IntelliSense would automatically preselect options, leading to unintended DAX function insertions when users pressed **Tab** or **Enter**. This is a common feedback item – thank you to everyone who provided this feedback! Now, IntelliSense only preselects suggestions after explicit actions, such as arrowing down or typing more specific inputs, ensuring an uninterrupted flow with **Tab** and **Enter** to structure the query as you type.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DQV-intellisense-improvements.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/DQV-intellisense-improvements.png)  \nBy prioritizing user intent, the improved IntelliSense behavior empowers people writing DAX queries to be more productive. This improvement is automatically part of Power BI Desktop starting with the April 2025 release and is available now when using DAX query view in the web.  \nNext steps:  \n1. Use **DAX query view** in Power BI Desktop with any semantic model, including live editing a Direct Lake model, and when creating a report with a live connection to a semantic model.\n2. **Write DAX queries** in the web on any published Power BI semantic model\n3.

Microsoft Fabric’s OneLake data is visualized in Power BI without duplicating data using the new Direct Lake storage mode. Power BI semantic models with Direct Lake tables can give you the latest data from the OneLake to visualize insights quickly and dynamically in Power BI reports and provide the right context for success with Copilot. Now, it’s even easier than ever, as you can create and edit Direct Lake semantic models in Power BI Desktop. And, for the first time with Direct Lake models, you can add tables from multiple data sources, giving you the full flexibility to use the OneLake data in Power BI.  \nLet’s get started by demonstrating how to create these Direct Lake semantic models in just a few clicks.  \nFirst, if you haven’t done so already, in the **Preview features** of **Options**select **Create semantic models in Direct Lake storage mode from one or more Fabric artifacts**.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Preview-feature-for-Direct-Lake-on-OneLake-in-Desktop.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Preview-feature-for-Direct-Lake-on-OneLake-in-Desktop.png)  \nThen, in a new Power BI Desktop instance, select a Lakehouse or Warehouse from the **OneLake catalog**,then **Connect**.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Connect-to-OneLake-in-OneLake-catalog.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Connect-to-OneLake-in-OneLake-catalog.png)  \nGive the semantic model a name, pick a workspace, and select the tables you want to include then **OK**.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Create-model-and-table-picker-in-Desktop.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Create-model-and-table-picker-in-Desktop.png)  \nThe semantic model is created in the service, accessing the data from the OneLake storage and now you are live editing the semantic model in Desktop, easy as that!  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Direct-Lake-model-created-in-Power-BI-Desktop.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Direct-Lake-model-created-in-Power-BI-Desktop.png)  \nTo bring in other tables from another Lakehouse or Warehouse, return to the **OneLake catalog**.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Add-more-data-sources-in-Direct-LAke.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Add-more-data-sources-in-Direct-LAke.png)  \nLike when you created the semantic model, just pick a Lakehouse or Warehouse and click **Connect**.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pick-another-data-source-in-OneLake-catalog.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pick-another-data-source-in-OneLake-catalog.png)  \nThis time you are already in a semantic model, so the name and workspace options are removed, just pick the tables and click **OK**.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pick-a-new-table-to-add.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Pick-a-new-table-to-add.png)  \nAnd it’s added to the semantic model!  \nFrom here you can **continue data modeling**: add relationships, measures, calculation groups, hierarchies, and more. DAX query view is available to view data in the tables and to try out calculations. TMDL (Tabular Model Definition Language) view is also available to make changes using code.  \nThe tables are all stored in the same OneLake, so regular relationships can be created between the tables, similar to the import experience.  \n**To create a report**, go to **File** > **Blank report** and then live connect to the semantic model you are also editing.

You can choose to export to Power BI Project to have a local copy of the metadata.  \nWhen created in Desktop, these Direct Lake tables are the new flavor of Direct Lake, called **Direct Lake on OneLake**. The existing Direct Lake, now called **Direct Lake on SQL**, behaves just like Direct Lake on OneLake when accessing data from the OneLake delta tables. The difference is what they can do in addition to Direct Lake mode.  \n* Direct Lake on OneLake never uses DirectQuery to access data. Direct Lake on SQL also can talk to the SQL endpoint using DirectQuery.Views are accessed using DirectQuery mode, not Direct Lake, unless they materialized as delta tables.\n* Direct Lake on OneLake is multi-source. You can use multiple Lakehouse or Warehouse tables in the same semantic model. Direct Lake on SQL is single source.\n* Direct Lake on OneLake permission is only dependent on each source itself. Currently, this is either a Lakehouse or Warehouse. Use the ‘ReadAll’ permission to enable access to the delta tables. Shortcut tables can only be accessed with [OneLake security early access](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_BIbobSVbtGoFFUDM3gfGJUNlBWWVpMNDU5NzY5U1NBQVFHOUJPNE5CNS4u). More information about shortcut tables is described below. Direct Lake on SQL permission is dependent on the SQL analytics endpoint of the source. Use the ‘ReadData’ permission to access delta tables through the SQL endpoint.\n* Direct Lake on OneLake semantic models are created and edited in Power BI Desktop. Support for creation and full editing in web is planned. Limited web modeling is supported at the start of the public preview. Direct Lake on SQL semantic models are created from the web in the Lakehouse or Warehouse by clicking **New semantic model** and can be edited in either web or Power BI Desktop.  \nDirect Lake on SQL does and will continue to have the fallback to DirectQuery option to be able to utilize the SQL endpoint. There is **no more fallback to DirectQuery available** when you create a Direct Lake on OneLake semantic model in Power BI Desktop. This Direct Lake storage mode only connects to the OneLake tables and is not downstream or impacted by the SQL analytics endpoint. The **Direct Lake behavior** option, found in **Model view > Data pane > Model explorer > Semantic model** node properties pane, will be greyed out to indicate this new Direct Lake on OneLake storage mode.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Direct-Lake-behavior-greyed-out.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Direct-Lake-behavior-greyed-out.png)  \nDirect Lake on OneLake doesn’t show or allow the use of views in the semantic model, unless they materialized as delta tables. Direct Lake on SQL shows and uses views in DirectQuery mode.  \nDuring the initial public preview,Direct Lake on OneLake doesn’t support the use of shortcut tables in the semantic model, or using any table in a Lakehouse opted into the public preview of ‘Manage OneLake data access (preview)’. Accessing any table, including shortcut tables, is supported if you [sign up for early access](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=v4j5cvGGr0GRqy180BHbR_BIbobSVbtGoFFUDM3gfGJUNlBWWVpMNDU5NzY5U1NBQVFHOUJPNE5CNS4u) of the [upcoming OneLake security](https://blog.fabric.microsoft.com/blog/the-next-evolution-of-onelake-security-enters-early-preview).  \n**Migrating an existing Direct Lake on SQL semantic model to Direct Lake on OneLake** is possible in Power BI Desktop now TMDL view is available in live edit.  \n1.

Open Power BI Desktop and turn on the **public preview** for **Create semantic models in Direct Lake storage mode from one or more Fabric artifacts.** Itis recommended to also turn on *Live edit of Power BI semantic models in Direct Lake mode* too, if it is not already turned on to edit the model you create later in Power BI Desktop.\n2. Go to **OneLake catalog** in the ribbon.\n3. Pick a Lakehouse or Warehouse with the tables you want to add and click **Connect**.\n4. Give your semantic model a name and pick the tables you want to use then click **OK**.  \nNow the semantic model in Direct Lake mode is created in the service and you are live editing the model in Power BI Desktop.  \n**To add tables from other OneLake Fabric artifacts,** such as Lakehouses or Warehouses, follow these steps.  \n1. Go to **OneLake catalog** again in the ribbon.\n2. Pick another Lakehouse or Warehouse with the tables you want to add and click **Connect**.\n3. Pick the tables you want to use then click **OK**.  \nThat’s it! Now you can continue to build your semantic model or add more tables from other Lakehouses or Warehouses.  \nIn addition, you can use the Power BI Project by going to **File** > **Export** > **Power BI Project.**  \n**To create a report** from this newly created semantic model there are many paths, but here is how you can do it in Power BI Desktop to get you started.",

Reference layers are additional layers of information that provide context to the main map features. Examples of reference layers include road networks that show streets and highways or political boundaries showing districts and zones on a map. Up until now, Power BI users could add reference layers on top of base maps, but the layer of information was static. Connecting your business data with reference layers data enables users to create interactive maps that update as the data changes in real-time. Additionally, with conditional formatting, colors, shapes, and sizes of the map visuals can be tailored to specific data thresholds, making it easier for users to spot trends, outliers, and areas that need immediate attention.  \nImagine a retailer evaluating new store locations. By overlaying demographic and income data as reference layers, the retailer can quickly assess regions with high potential. With conditional formatting, income levels above a certain threshold could be displayed in one color, while lower income areas are displayed in another, making it easy to spot regions with high purchasing power. This data-driven approach allows the retailer to pinpoint the most promising sites for expansion, maximizing investment in the right areas.  \n[Learn more about how to use this capability](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-maps/power-bi-visual-add-reference-layer?tabs=upload).  \n![Azure Maps visual adds support for data-bound reference layers](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/dymanic_reference_demo.gif)",

[Gender Parity](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Gender-Parity-Throughout-the-Olypmics-a-Sanofi-Viz-Olympics-2024/m-p/4420431)  \n#### **Competition Overview**  \nThe Viz Olympics was launched by Sanofi’s Visual Analytics Community Leads, Anu Stanley and Jennifer Gan, in August 2024, attracting an impressive turnout of Sanofi employees. The objective was clear: to create innovative visualizations that explore Olympic data and tell compelling stories through dashboards and infographics.  \n#### **Why the Olympics?**  \nSanofi’s sponsorship of the Paris 2024 Olympic Games made this a particularly meaningful topic. Over 2,000 Sanofi employees volunteered, demonstrating that the sponsorship was not only a company initiative but also a collectively shared passion.  \nThe Olympics are not just about sports; they encompass a rich tapestry of economic, social, and environmental impacts – and this was well embodied by the data chosen by the competitors.  \n#### **The Power of Power BI**  \nPower BI was chosen as the tool for this competition, reflecting its status as Sanofi’s corporate standard. Participants benefited from coaching sessions with Microsoft experts, which helped them refine their ideas and produce exceptional reports!  \n#### **Judging Criteria**  \nThe competition was judged on three main criteria: design, analytics, and storytelling. Participants were encouraged to think beyond traditional business dashboards and explore innovative styles that could captivate and inform their audience. The judges looked for aesthetic appeal, clarity, simplicity, data accuracy, depth of insights, relevance, context, narrative flow, engagement, and impact.  \n#### **Finalists and Grand Finale**  \nThe competition saw 131 participants forming 85 teams from 25 countries. After rigorous evaluation, three teams emerged as finalists, each presenting their solutions to the panel of judges. The grand finale was a showcase of extraordinary talent and creativity.  \n#### **Winners**  \nThe winners were crowned amidst much celebration 🎉  \n**🎉1st place:**  \n[Olympic Performance Index](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Olympic-Performance-Index-Sanofi-Viz-Olympics-2024/m-p/4588534#M14052)  \n*Team France: Thomas Chaussy, Catherine Claret, Isabelle Miquet*  \n[![Olympic performance index dashboard](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1st-place-300x149.png)](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Olympic-Performance-Index-Sanofi-Viz-Olympics-2024/m-p/4588534#M14052)  \n**🎉2nd place:**  \n[Isometric Story Telling](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Sanofi-Viz-Olympics-2024-A-New-Isometric-Dimension/m-p/4587791#M14050)  \n*Team Great Britan: Joe Clarkson, Farhan Farrukh, Asif Ashraf*  \n[![Isometric dimensions of the Olympics dashboard](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/2nd-place-1-300x164.png)](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Sanofi-Viz-Olympics-2024-A-New-Isometric-Dimension/m-p/4587791#M14050)  \n**🎉 3rdplace:**  \n[Gender Parity](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Gender-Parity-Throughout-the-Olypmics-a-Sanofi-Viz-Olympics-2024/m-p/4420431)  \n*Team Canada: Carene Contante*  \n[![Gender parity in the olympics dashboard](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/04/3rd-place-300x170.png)](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Data-Stories-Gallery/Gender-Parity-Throughout-the-Olypmics-a-Sanofi-Viz-Olympics-2024/m-p/4420431)  \n#### **Gratitude and Future Prospects**  \nA huge heartfelt thanks goes out to the organizers, sponsors, selection committee, and judges who made this event possible. Sanofi’s Viz Olympics has set a high standard for future competitions, proving that with Power BI, analysts can achieve remarkable feats in data visualization.  \nFinally, we want to give a shoutout to the awesome Microsoft team who jumped in as facilitators, coaches, and judges : Emilie Maréchal, Imène Kabla, Marc Reguera, Sandrine Tarnaud, Manel Omani and Camille Guedj. Their skills, guidance, and non-stop support helped make the event a massive hit!  \nJoin us in celebrating the success of this inspiring initiative and in looking forward to more opportunities for creativity, innovation, and learning in the world of data analytics.  \n#VisualAnalytics #VizOlympics #PowerBI #Innovation #ParisOlympics",

Org apps are the future of Power BI workspace apps. With org apps you can create more than one app per workspace, customize your app experiences in brand new ways, include new item types like notebooks, and much more. Check out [the prior blog post for more information on org apps in preview now](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-org-apps-now-in-public-preview-multiple-apps-per-workspace-custom-colors-and-more/).  \nWe’ve heard a lot of positive feedback on org apps and clear suggestions on what we should build next to meet your organization’s data distribution and consumption needs. With your feedback, we’ve made several updates to org apps and have more in the works. Let’s get right to what’s new and then we’ll cover what’s coming next as we work towards general availability of org apps.  \n![Conceptual illustration of features now available in org apps; nav options, git, pipelines](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/org-app-features-now-available-1.png)  \n**Now available:**  \n* New combined navigation setting for customizing your org apps.\n* Git support for org app developers looking for version history.\n* Deployment pipelines for staging and testing your org apps across workspaces.  \n![Conceptual illustration of features coming soon to org apps; mobile, and audiences](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/org-app-features-coming-next.png)  \n**What’s next:**  \n* Support for org apps in Pro workspaces.\n* Add paginated reports to org apps, with org app-managed access propagation for semantic models.\n* View org apps in Power BI mobile apps.\n* Conditionally display content in org apps via audiences.\n* Fabric item APIs for creating and modifying org apps.",

        "content": "# New and available now in org apps  \n### Introducing new customization options for org apps (Preview) – combined navigation  \nMake just the right org app, with new navigation options!  \nWe’re enhancing org app customization with the combined navigation setting, giving authors more control over the consumer experience through multiple navigation configurations. Previously, org apps had separate navigation panes for the app and the report. Now, you can choose to show a single pane with report pages within the app navigation pane, eliminating the need for two separate panes. This provides a more streamlined and cohesive user experience.  \n![Screenshot showing navigation settings for org apps with the combined navigation option now available](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/org-app-combined-nav-available-screenshot-1.png)  \nCovered in [the original org apps announcement (Preview)](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-org-apps-now-in-public-preview-multiple-apps-per-workspace-custom-colors-and-more/), org apps (Preview) offer customization beyond workspace apps, and the new combined navigation option gives you even more to choose from. You can choose to have the org app navigation collapsed, expanded, or turned off by default. For those who prefer visible org app navigation, the combined navigation experience provides additional flexibility and control. Or when a report is in view, you can opt for separate navigation of pages within the report. Explore these configurations to create a unique and tailored experience for different groups within your organization.  \nThis new option of combining the org app navigation and report navigation is like what the previous version of org apps offered, known as workspace apps. Workspace apps provided a unified navigation experience, and the combined navigation experience in org apps builds on that foundation by offering even more customization options. By combining the navigation panes, org app consumers can enjoy a seamless and efficient way to access and interact with data in your org apps that may be familiar to them from workspace apps.  \nFor more information on how you can customize your org apps, from custom branding to navigation settings, check out the Microsoft Learn documentation for[Get started with org apps (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/org-app-items/org-app-items#customizing-your-org-app)",

Previously, workspace apps allowed report authors to iterate on reports across just two stages without affecting the published copy. Now, with deployment pipelines support for org app items, you can create, manage, and deploy in stages that match your workflow. Unlike workspace apps that support only two stages, org apps with deployment pipelines offer the flexibility to add multiple stages based on your needs.  \nFor example, a four-stage pipeline. After changes have been finalized, [Fabric deployment pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines) enable org app authors or developers to automate or manually control the deployment of changes across different workspaces used for 1. development > 2. testing > 3. review > 4. production stages.  \n![Screenshot of deployment pipelines for org apps, including 1. dev stage, 2. testing stage, 3. review stage, and 4. production stage](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/org-app-pipelines-screenshot-1.png)  \n**Deployment pipelines enable org app authors and developers to:**  \n* Ensure that org apps remain in sync with earlier stages.\n* Verify and deploy changes quickly and reliably.\n* Use [‘Select related’](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/understand-the-deployment-process?tabs=new-ui#autobinding-in-the-same-workspace) to promote included items during deployment.\n* Reduce the risk of errors and conflicts from manual interventions or inconsistent configurations.\n* Visually compare org apps side by side across distinct stages.\n* Ultimately, deliver quality org app experiences to your consumers.  \nDeployment pipelines empower teams to produce updates in short cycles with high speed, frequency, and consistency, allowing changes to be promoted at any time with a single click. **These updates highlight the future of workspace apps being prepared within org apps (preview) by leveraging the power of the Fabric platform.** As we work towards the general availability of org apps, we look forward to hearing your feedback and continuing to enhance org apps to meet your consumer distribution and consumption needs.  \nLearn more about continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for org apps (Preview): [CI/CD for org apps in Fabric (Preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/org-app-items/org-app-cicd)",

Each time you (or others) view this visualization in this slide the annotations will be loaded as well. But these annotations will not be presented when you are viewing the same visualization in Power BI service or in any other place; the annotations are at your aid in the context of the presentation they were created at. It also means that you can have multiple sets of annotations for the same visualization; each set provides content that is truly in the context of the presentation you are building.  \nAnnotations will be displayed whenever the data point is visible. So, if the visual is filtered, resulting in the disappearance of the data point, the annotation will likewise disappear. Additionally, if the data updates and the data point is no longer part of the visual, the annotation will not be shown as well.  \nAlthough it is not possible to add new annotations in presentation mode, users can still manage the visibility of annotations during presentations, making the storytelling even more dynamic and engaging. A new action for annotations is now available in the footer (Data actions->Annotations) that allows users to hide or show annotations entirely. If annotations exist in the visual, but are currently hidden, you will see a badge notification indicating you that there are hidden annotations that you can reveal.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/showhide_edited.gif)  \nWe hope you enjoy this new update and invite you to use annotation in your next business presentation.

Including these in your model gives Copilot additional context about how to use your data and leverages existing data structures to accelerate and improve DAX queries.  \nFor instance, you can reference measures grouped in a specific folder to be shown by a hierarchy, and Copilot will generate a DAX query with those measures by that hierarchy with a simple user request. Using hierarchies and display folders streamlines the process of writing complex DAX queries. Especially in models with many measures or columns, display folders can help organize and logically group them.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-25.png)  \nColumns and measures can be added to display folders using the **Properties** pane in the **Model view**. Patrick LeBlanc has a 2-minute video on how you can create hierarchies with [EASILY create a Hierarchy in Power BI Desktop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y0T_KkeWyQ).  \nThis is in addition to the recent updates allowing Copilot to understand your data better by using descriptions and synonyms on columns, tables, and measures. And including sample values from columns.

This month we’ve enhanced the language understanding layer by further leveraging an LLM to interpret and understand common synonyms, phrasings, and individual values in your model mentioned in your questions. In summary, Copilot can now understand more of your questions out-of-the-box!  \nPreviously, certain questions required the report author to curate terms to ensure Copilot could correctly understand and answer accurately. Now, with the full power of an LLM, Copilot can understand significantly more questions out-of-the-box, saving the report author curation time and saving the Copilot user time clarifying common terms.  \n|  |  |\n| --- | --- |\n| **Before** | **After** |\n| Previously, Copilot struggled to understand that tea is a synonym for chai in the data without the report author adding this mapping to Q&A setup.

A screenshot of a phone AI-generated content may be incorrect. |\n| Previously, Copilot struggled to understand what ‘export’ could mean in relation to products and suppliers. A screenshot of a chat AI-generated content may be incorrect. | Now, Copilot understands this by default and saves the user a click to confirm this common relationship.   A screenshot of a phone AI-generated content may be incorrect. |\n| Previously, Copilot needed clarification for which instance value Ana refers to, even though there’s only 1 match in the data.

Now, Copilot pane can generate DAX queries to answer questions that require ad hoc calculations.  \nQuestions such as:  \n* What was the year-over-year growth for sales?\n* How many employees were hired before 2020?\n* Calculate the ratio of cosmetic product orders to all products.\n* Which customers did not buy any products?  \nYou can also verify the DAX query directly from the expanded view or launch DAX query view for further inspection.  \n![A screenshot of a phone AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/a-screenshot-of-a-phone-ai-generated-content-may-6.png)  \n![A screenshot of a chat AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/a-screenshot-of-a-chat-ai-generated-content-may-b-7.png)  \nNote: This is currently only available from **Edit Mode** of reports using Copilot.

This feature transforms data storytelling by allowing users to communicate insights with greater efficacy and enhance the engagement and informativeness of presentations.  \nTo utilize annotations, you first need to embed a single visual within the add-in in a slide. Then, simply select a data point on the visual, right-click, and choose ‘Annotate.’ You can then begin typing your text. You can reference the data point’s measure value and category values in the annotation, ensuring the content is connected to the actual data point. Typing ‘/’provides options that can be included in the annotation text.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-27.png)  \nAnnotations will display whenever the data point is visible. If the visual is filtered, resulting in the disappearance of the data point, the annotation will likewise disappear. Additionally, if the data updates and the data point is no longer part of the visual, the annotation will not be shown as well.  \nAnnotations are specific to the presentation and slide where the visual was added, allowing users to provide content that is truly in the context of their presentation.  \n**Notes:**  \n1. Annotations are not supported in custom visuals.\n2. Annotations are supported in all Power BI native Cartesians visuals.\n3. Annotations are available only when embedding a single visual view, and not a page view.  \nLearn more about [data annotations](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-power-bi-powerpoint-add-in-annotate).",

[Setting up Git](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/cicd/git-integration/git-get-started?tabs=azure-devops%2CAzure%2Ccommit-to-git) is as easy as a couple of clicks. Configure the Git repository and branch details in the workspace settings to set up a connection. Once set up, commit org app changes with confidence, knowing you can version or branch as you iterate on org app items and included items in your workspace.  \n![Image illustrating Git integration benefits: work with versions, keep a history, code together, automate tasks](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/image-illustrating-git-integration-benefits-work-1.png)  \n**Git enables org app developers to:**  \n* Backup and version of their org app item, along with included items.\n* See version history and revert to previous versions of org apps and included content as needed.\n* Collaborate on org apps with others or iterate on your own using Git branches.\n* Automate or script tasks around your processes.  \n**Deployment Pipelines for Org Apps (Continuous Deployment)**  \nItems included in an org app (preview), like reports, use the source item in the workspace for display in the org app, unlike workspace apps that display versioned copies of included items after workspace app update. To date, workspace apps have allowed report authors to iterate on reports across just two stages without impacting the published copy of the report in a workspace app.  \nNow, with deployment pipelines support for org app items, you can create, manage, and deploy in stages that match your workflow. Compared to workspace apps that support just two stages, org apps support for deployment pipelines gives you the flexibility to add several stages based on your needs.  \nFor example, after changes have been finalized, [Fabric deployment pipelines](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/intro-to-deployment-pipelines) enable org app authors or developers to automate or manually control the deployment of changes across different workspaces used for 1. development, 2. testing, 3. review, and 4. production stages.  \n![Screenshot of new deployment pipelines interface illustrating four stages of org app and included content deployment: org app development, org app testing, org app review, and production org app stages...each stage having its own assigned workspace that content is deployed to.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/screenshot-of-new-deployment-pipelines-interface-i-1.png)  \n**Deployment pipelines enable org app authors and developers to:**  \n* Ensure that org apps are in sync with earlier stages.\n* Verify and deploy changes quickly and reliably.\n* Use [‘Select related’](https://learn.microsoft.com/fabric/cicd/deployment-pipelines/understand-the-deployment-process?tabs=new-ui#autobinding-in-the-same-workspace) to ensure items included in the org app are also promoted during deployment.\n* Reduce the risk of errors and conflicts that might arise from manual interventions or inconsistent configurations.\n* Compare org apps across different environments.\n* Ultimately, ensure the delivery of quality org app experiences to your org app consumers.  \nDeployment pipelines empower teams to produce updates in short cycles with high speed, frequency, and consistency. Changes can be promoted at any time with a single click.  \n**With these updates, you’re seeing the future of workspace apps being prepared within org apps (preview) by building on the power of the Fabric platform.** As we work towards org apps general availability, we look forward to hearing your feedback and continuing to build out org apps to meet your consumer distribution and consumption needs.  \nFor more information, see Microsoft Learn documentation related to CI/CD and org apps:  \n* [Continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) for org apps (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/org-app-items/org-app-cicd)\n* [Org apps (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/org-app-items/org-app-items)",

This new functionality allows org app authors to have more control over their consumer experience by offering several navigation configurations.  \nPreviously, org apps had separate navigation panes; one for the org app itself and another for the report in view. With the combined navigation experience, you can now choose to show a single pane with report pages within the app navigation pane, eliminating the need for two separate navigation panes. This means that the pages of reports will be shown underneath the reports listed in the org app navigation pane, providing a more streamlined and cohesive user experience.  \n![Screenshot showing that the combined navigation setting for org apps is now available.

And by adding this new combined navigation option you can customize an org app even more. Starting with whether you prefer to have the org app navigation collapsed or expanded by default. Or even turn off the org app navigation completely. And for those who prefer to show org app navigation, the combined navigation experience offers additional flexibility and control. Or, when a report is in view, you can choose to show a separate navigation of pages in the report. Explore these configurations and other combinations for your org apps. This level of customization ensures that you can create a unique and tailored experience for different groups within your organization.  \nThis new option of combining the org app navigation and report navigation is like the previous version of org apps offered, known as workspace apps. Workspace apps allowed for a unified navigation experience, and the combined navigation experience in org apps builds on that foundation by providing even more customization options. By combining the navigation panes, org app consumers can enjoy a seamless and efficient way to access and interact with data in your org apps that may be familiar to them from workspace apps.  \nFor more information on how you can customize your org apps, from custom branding to navigation settings, see Microsoft Learn documentation for org apps (preview):  \n[Get started with org apps (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/org-app-items/org-app-items#customizing-your-org-app).",

Initially, it supported the foundational attribute chart types, including the c chart, u chart, Laney u chart, p chart, Laney p chart, and np chart.  \n![A diagram of a company Description automatically generated](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/03/a-diagram-of-a-company-description-automatically-1.png)  \nNow, we’re excited to announce expanded capabilities with support for Rare Event Control Charts — specifically, the T chart and G chart. These charts are essential for monitoring events that occur infrequently, allowing for more nuanced control in scenarios where traditional control charts may not be sensitive enough. The T chart helps monitor the time between rare events, while the G chart tracks the count of opportunities between events. These new additions make the Attribute Control Chart even more versatile, enabling organizations to gain insights into low-frequency incidents, which are often critical yet challenging to monitor.  \nBy expanding Power BI’s Attribute Control Chart functionality, we continue to support diverse business needs, helping teams identify issues promptly and maintain high-quality standards across all processes.  \nReady to experience the Attribute Control Chart?

The Power BI Premium product capabilities will not change, and you can continue using your existing Power BI Premium capacity until the time of your next renewal. However, the sale and renewals for PSKUs officially ended and existing Power BI Premium customers will need to transition to a Microsoft Fabric SKU at the end of their current agreement.  \nAs you transition to a Fabric SKU, we want to help ensure you keep access to all your data and can continue your existing work. That’s why we previously announced that you have 90 days to access your data in Power BI while you transition. Based on your feedback, and to support you during the transition period, we are also providing free Power BI Premium capacity for the first 30 days after the end of your previous subscription. The amount of free capacity will match the amount offered by your previously purchased P-SKU. This should reduce the need to pay for two capacities at the same time.Completing this transition will take time and we strongly recommend purchasing F-SKU as soon as your P-SKU subscription ends, so you can utilize the entire 30 days to plan and execute the migration.",

[Introduced for phones several months ago](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/blog/introducing-copilot-in-power-bi-mobile-apps-preview/), Copilot in the Power BI Mobile apps empowered users to quickly analyze data, gain insights, and make informed decisions on the go. Now, the same powerful capabilities have come to iPads and Android tablets, making it easier than ever for you to explore your data anytime, anywhere.  \nGetting started with Copilot on your mobile app is easy, simply tap the Copilot button located in the report header ([for reports that meet Copilot requirements in Power BI](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/create-reports/copilot-introduction#copilot-requirements)). From there, you can choose whether to receive a summary or uncover insights. Copilot will deliver a response based on your request, which you can then copy, share, or continue interacting with. Suggestions at the bottom of the screen help you refine your request or create new ones, making it simple to explore your data further.  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m.png)",

This month, we’ve revamped our previous ‘show reasoning’ section to a new detailed section we’re calling ‘How Copilot arrived at this’.  \nWhen receiving a visual answer from Copilot, expand this new section to dig into what data (fields/measures) and filters were used to generate the answer. You can also click on the field to see more information like the aggregation or home table.  \nThis is especially helpful when there could be multiple fields with the same name, like having multiple Dates in your data, verifying Copilot picked the correct one.  \n![A screenshot of a chat AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-screenshot-of-a-chat-ai-generated-content-may-b.png)  \nAs a reminder, Copilot does not currently incorporate existing filters from the report when generating a visual answer.

This month we’ve replaced the previous ‘expand view’ action with our fully interactive Explore feature. Even better, you can use the feature in both read and edit modes of a report.  \nWith Explore, quick actions are now possible from Copilot. Simply open the Explore experience to filter, sort, swap fields, or change visual types easily for ad-hoc exploration.  \n![A screenshot of a chat AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-screenshot-of-a-chat-ai-generated-content-may-b-1.png)  \n![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be incorrect.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/02/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-ai-generated-content-m-1.png) You can choose to save the new explore visual to a report or an exploration to come back to.  \n**Note:** Saving the new visual to the original report is not yet available.  \nExplore does have [certain limitations](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/consumer/explore-data-service#to-create), some users may still see the ‘**expand view**’ button if requirements to use Explore are not met.",

        "content": "## Reporting  \n### Conditional formatting support for visual calculations (Preview)  \nAnother month, more updates to visual calculations. This month we are introducing another customer request: support for conditional formatting! You can now use visual calculations to set up conditional formatting rules for columns and measures on your visuals. Also, you can now apply condition formatting rules to visual calculations.  \nOnce you open the conditional formatting dialog you will notice there is a new section that shows the data that’s on your visual. This section includes any column, measure and visual calculations on your visual and will include any hidden fields as well.  \nFor example, here I have a simple visual that shows sales by quarter using a Total Sales measure and the Fiscal Quarter column. I have added a visual calculation that for each quarter calculates the difference with the first quarter:  \n```\nVSFirst = [Total Sales] - FIRST( [Total Sales] )\n```  \nI have hidden the VSFirst calculation and am going to use it to set a conditional background color for the fiscal quarter. In the conditional formatting dialog, we see the data in this visual section:  \n![Screenshot of Power BI Desktop showing the Background Color conditional formatting dialog for the Fiscal Quarter column. The 'What field should we base this on' dropdown is open.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-of-power-bi-desktop-showing-the-backgro.png)  \nAll your model data is still accessible, it is in the ‘All data’ section.  \nNext, select VSFirst visual calculation and set up the rule as usual:  \n![Screenshot of the conditional formatting dialog for background color for Fiscal Quarter. It shows a gradient set up based on the hidden VSFirst visual calculation.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-of-the-conditional-formatting-dialog-fo.png)  \nAnd the conditional formatting is applied:  \n![Screenshot of a Power BI table with the gradient conditional formatting rule applies to the Fiscal Quarter column.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-of-a-power-bi-table-with-the-gradient-c.png)  \nAs mentioned, you can also format the visual calculations themselves, as done here with the same visual calculation that was made visible to show the result:  \n![Screenshot of Power BI Desktop showing the conditional formatting dialog for the VSFirst visual calculation.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-of-power-bi-desktop-showing-the-conditi.png)  \n[Learn more about visual calculations in our documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-visual-calculations-overview) and please let us know what you think!",

Your request will include the context of where you are, using metadata from tables, columns, and measures, such as names and data types.  \nWith this update, additional information is included to help Copilot understand the semantic model.  \n* **Descriptions** are a property on the model where you provide additional information about a column, table, or measure to help model consumers when building reports. This is great for spelling out acronyms. For example, for a measure called ‘YOY Growth’ the description could be ‘Year over year growth in sales, based on same range starting 12 months prior.’ To keep Copilot response fast, Copilot can only see the first 200 characters. Descriptions can be added in the **Properties** pane of any table, object, or measure selected in the **Model explorer,** available in the **Data** pane of **Model** view or in the new [**TMDL view**](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-dataset#tmdl-format). There is also a [Copilot to help write descriptions of measures](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/transform-model/desktop-measure-copilot-descriptions) in a model, which is highly recommended as consumers of the model, with or without Copilot, can only see name and description and do not see the DAX formula itself.\n* **Synonyms** can be added to provide alternative names or how others may reference this column. This can help Copilot identify the right column to use if the user request uses a synonym. For example, to keep the axis label shorter the column is named ‘YOY Growth’, the synonyms could include ‘Yearly growth’, ‘YOY Change’, and ‘Year over year delta’. about how to add synonyms. Synonyms can also be added in the **Properties** pane of any table, column, or measure selected in the **Model explorer,** available in the **Data** pane of **Model** view and there is a [Copilot to help you add these synonyms](https://learn.microsoft.com/power-bi/natural-language/q-and-a-copilot-enhancements).\n* **Sample values** include the minimum and maximum values of a column. This gives the context of the numerical or date range and text examples. For example, the range of quantities ordered could be from 1 to 10 or 10 to 100, and a column of state names may be entered as ‘WA’ or ‘Washington’. You do not have to add these, we will do this automatically for you.  \nHere I have a semantic model where I have added in synonyms and descriptions.  \n**Let’s see the power of descriptions.** The model includes a calculated table with information about the semantic model’s tables, which is a self-documenting technique. The table is called ‘xTables’ which does not convey that purpose well but does put it at the bottom of the table list, which was why it was named that way. The description for this table can give more context with ‘This is information about this semantic model’s tables.’ Now when I ask Copilot to tell me more about the tables in this semantic model, the DAX query returned utilizes that table.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAX-queries-Copilot-using-description-on-table.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAX-queries-Copilot-using-description-on-table.png)  \nNote, the DAX function INFO.VIEW.TABLES() was used in the calculated table, which can also be run as a DAX query if you have permission to edit the model. If you only have permission to view and run queries, you cannot run that DAX function and would only be able to get the information from this table.  \nAnd in the case of column name using an acronym, the description can remove ambiguity on what it may mean, and Copilot can find the correct measure to use. Here I have a measure abbreviated to ‘S/O’, which I provide additional context for with the description, ‘Calculates the average sales per order by dividing the total sales by the total number of orders.’ Now when I request ‘Write a DAX query to show average sales per order’, Copilot can find the correct measure to use.  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAX-queries-Copilot-using-description-on-measure-1.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAX-queries-Copilot-using-description-on-measure-1.png)  \n**Let’s see how synonyms can help**. The model has a measure called [Costs] but it has a synonym of ‘expenses’. I can now ask Copilot using the synonym and I get the data I was expecting from the DAX query.[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAX-queries-Copilot-using-synonyms.png)](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/DAX-queries-Copilot-using-synonyms.png)  \n**Finally, let’s see how sample values can help**.

The values for states in this model are spelled out instead of using abbreviations.",

This new feature lets you script, modify, and apply changes using [Tabular Model Definition Language (TMDL)](https://learn.microsoft.com/analysis-services/tmdl/tmdl-overview), providing an alternative experience to semantic modeling using code, instead of a graphical user interface such as[Model view](https://github.com/davidiseminger/powerbi-docs-pr/blob/97de578349a04088648f1c7e00ce2ee5726a224b/powerbi-docs/transform-model/desktop-relationship-view.md). Future updates will integrate Copilot, laying the foundation for advanced Copilot modeling interactions handling time-intensive tasks such as model translations, bulk operations, among others.  \n**TMDL view** enhances the semantic modeling experience for Power BI developers, offering several advantages:  \n* **Enhanced development efficiency**with a rich code editor that includes search-and-replace, keyboard shortcuts, multi-line edits and more.\n* **Increase reusability**by easily scripting, sharing, and reusing TMDL scripts among semantic model developers.\n* **Gain more control and transparency**, showing all semantic model objects and properties, and allowing changes to items not available in the Power BI Desktop user interface.  \nWatch the **TMDL view** demo in the [January 2025 update video](https://youtu.be/TtyMWWsw4K4?si=YQ8iKWg11eLNK_ap&t=329) (minute 5:26):  \n[![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Semantic-Modeling-as-Code-with-TMDL-1024x576.png)](https://youtu.be/TtyMWWsw4K4?si=YQ8iKWg11eLNK_ap&t=329)",

For instance, if you need to remove the prefix “dim\\_*” or “fact\\_*” from all your tables, you can script the full model, search for “dim\\_*|fact\\_*” (as a regular expression), and replace it with an empty string.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TMDLView_FindReplace.png)  \nWhen you’re ready, you can select the**Apply**button to execute the TMDL script against the semantic model and have your TMDL code changes applied in a single step.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TMDLView_Apply.png)  \nWhen successful, a notification is displayed, and your modeling change are applied to the semantic model.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TMDLView_ApplySuccess.png)  \nIn the event of a failure, an error notification is displayed to show that your modeling changes weren’t applied to the semantic model.

This will make them easily accessible for any Power BI developer within your organization, enabling them to efficiently reuse these scripts in their semantic models .  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TMDLView_Sharepoint.png)  \n**TMDL view** is also excellent for community and social media sharing.

For example, PBIP and Visual Studio Code can be used to update the semantic model definition without launching Power BI Desktop. The **TMDL view** in Power BI Desktop can be used to easily apply multiple changes to the semantic model efficiently. Both experiences with the same rich TMDL code experience.",

We have heard your feedback about the current file picker and have made tremendous efforts in this new update to more closely align the Power BI file picker to Office experiences that you are familiar with.  \n**New updates include:**  \n* Improved experience when opening and saving files in One Drive and SharePoint.\n* Easy access to reports in OneDrive and SharePoint.\n* Navigating between folders in various workspaces.\n* Adding new folders to existing workspaces.\n* Pinning folders and files in the file picker.  \nNow, when you select the Open button in Power BI backstage, you will clearly see a delineation between recent files, OneDrive, and SharePoint. We’ve made it clearer to navigate within your file structure and find the file you need. You can also add new folders as needed.  \n![Selecting a file in the Power BI file picker](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2024/11/power-bi-desktop-odsp-select-file-update-1024x511.png)  \nNew updates to the file picker make it easier to navigate between folders and select files.  \nNow, you can also pin and unpin recent files and folders in the file picker when opening Power BI files from OneDrive and SharePoint. Simply select or deselect the pin icon next to the file/folder to pin or unpin the item. Once an item has been pinned, it will be seen at the top of your ‘Recent’ section. A tooltip is also visible when you hover over the icon to make it clear whether the file is pinned or unpinned.  \n![pinning a folder in the new Power BI file picker. ](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2024/11/power-bi-desktop-odsp-pin-file-1024x197.png)  \nYou can now easily pin and unpin both files and folders in the “Recent” section of the new file picker.  \nWe understand that these updates may interrupt your workflows, so **these updates are not on by default.** To access the updates, open the latest desktop app, navigate to Options and settings (under the File Menu) > Options > Preview features, click the checkbox to enable ‘Show the new file saving and open experience’ then select ‘OK’ to accept the setting.  \nThese settings will be on by default in early 2025, and will then no longer require an opt-in.  \n![Image of the preview selector in Power BI desktop.](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2024/11/power-bi-desktop-odsp-file-picker.png)  \nOverview of the options to select to enable the new file picker.  \nWe hope you enjoy these new updates, and we’d love to hear any feedback you may have in the comments or via [our feedback forum](https://community.fabric.microsoft.com/t5/Desktop/bd-p/power-bi-designer).

To enable the **Text slicer**, go to **Options and settings** > **Options** > **Preview features** > **Text slicer visual** to make sure it is selected, then restart Power BI.  \nThis month’s enhancement adds a new **Slicer settings** control with an on/off toggle allowing the slicer to **Accept multiple values**. All other existing formatting options for the **Input text**, **Apply button**, and **Input text box** from our November update remain the same in the Format pane.  \nAfter creating a Text slicer visual and adding a text field from the data model, users can filter the dataset based on user input. Simply click the slicer input box, type your text, and apply the filter either by clicking the apply icon, pressing enter, or clicking outside the visual. The slicer immediately filters and displays the results, and you can repeat these steps to add more text selections.  \nWhen the **Accept multiple values** option is enabled, additional text can be added to the slicer by repeating these steps, thereby allowing multiple selections for filtering the dataset. Keep in mind that switching the toggle on or off will clear any previous text selections.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/TextSlicerImage.png)  \nAdding filtering with multiple values brings more control to data slicing, and we encourage users to explore this new feature and provide feedback. Future enhancements are still planned as we continue to improve Power BI’s visualization capabilities with the Text slicer.  \nThe addition of filtering with multiple values offers enhanced control over data slicing, and users are invited to explore this feature and provide feedback.

        "content": "## Enhancements to Treemap visual  \nThis month’s update includes significant enhancements to the Treemap visual, with three new tiling methods that improve layout options, plus new spacing controls to enhance the visual’s appearance and usability. These features offer richer control and customization, resulting in more precise and aesthetically pleasing treemaps in Power BI.  \nTreemap visuals are powerful tools for data visualization that allow users to represent hierarchical data through nested rectangles. Each branch of the hierarchy is represented by a rectangle, which is then tiled with smaller rectangles representing sub-branches. This structure allows for quick comparison of different category proportions.  \nTo generate two-level Treemap visuals, ensure that both the Category and Details fields are enabled. This allows you to visualize the hierarchical relationships between various categories and their subcategories in a clear and organized manner.  \n**Three new Tiling methods:**  \n**Squarified:** This method uses a squarified treemap algorithm to prevent elongated rectangles, creating a balanced layout. It arranges rectangles so their aspect ratios are close to squares, making size comparisons potentially easier.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/word-image-28821-7.png)  \n**Binary:** This method continuously divides the chart area into two sections while incrementally adding new rectangles/nodes creating a balanced and visually appealing treemap. Each hierarchy level further splits the space, resulting in an organized treemap that adapts to the dataset’s structure. It may produce different visual characteristics compared to squarified algorithm depending on the dataset.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/word-image-28821-8.png)  \n**Alternating** (Columns, Rows): The Alternating method clearly distinguishes categories by first splitting them by columns and then within each column by rows. This method effectively organizes datasets with numerous hierarchical levels  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/word-image-28821-9.png)  \nThis month’s update also introduces new spacing options to enhance the readability and appearance of the Treemap visual:  \n* **Space between all nodes:** This setting introduces gaps between adjacent nodes at all hierarchy levels, reducing clutter and improving clarity.\n* **Space between groups:** By adding extra space around each node group, this option visually separates different hierarchical groups, which helps to visually distinguish categories within the hierarchy.  \n![](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/word-image-28821-10.png)  \nThis update to our Treemap visual has brought improvements that reflect the commitment of the Core Visuals team to delivering the tools and features most requested by our users.  \nYour feedback helps us refine and expand the capabilities of core visuals. Test these Treemap enhancements and share your thoughts in the comments section below or visit our [Core Visuals LinkedIn blog](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pbicorevisuals/), to leave comments, and find up-to-date news, developments, and announcements.  \nLearn about our new [Core Visuals Vision Board](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/core-visuals-vision-board-pbicorevisuals-d1dhf/), where you users can vote on upcoming features and see what is in the pipeline.

For example, use a centralized SharePoint site to easily share reusable semantic model objects such as calendar tables or time intelligence calculation groups.\n* **Get more control and transparency**, showing all semantic model objects and properties, and allowing changes to items not available in Desktop GUI, such as [IsAvailableInMDX](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices.tabular.column.isavailableinmdx?view=analysisservices-dotnet#microsoft-analysisservices-tabular-column-isavailableinmdx) or [DetailRowsDefinition](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices.tabular.measure.detailrowsdefinition?view=analysisservices-dotnet#microsoft-analysisservices-tabular-measure-detailrowsdefinition).  \nScript any semantic model object such as table, measure, column or perspective by selecting the objects from Data pane and dragging them into the code editor:  \n![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-3.png)  \nTMDL view will script the selected objects as a TMDL script and just like [TMDL in VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=analysis-services.TMDL) you get an enriched code experience with features such as semantic highlighting, error diagnostics and autocomplete.  \n![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-4.png)  \nYou may change any valid property or object within the semantic model. For instance, the example below demonstrates how to modify the [displayFolder](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices.tabular.measure.displayfolder?view=analysisservices-dotnet#microsoft-analysisservices-tabular-measure-displayfolder) property and [detail rows definition](https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/api/microsoft.analysisservices.tabular.measure.detailrowsdefinition?view=analysisservices-dotnet#microsoft-analysisservices-tabular-measure-detailrowsdefinition) of multiple measures:  \n![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-5.png)  \nWhen ready you can hit the **Apply** button to execute the TMDL script against the semantic model to get your changes applied.  \n![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-6.png)  \nWhen successful, an instant notification will be displayed, and your modeling change will be applied to the semantic model.  \n![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-7.png)  \nIn the event of a failure, your modeling changes will not be applied to the semantic model, and you can view more information about the error by clicking on **show details**, which expands the Output pane with the error details.  \n![A screenshot of a computer Description automatically generated](https://powerbiblogsfd-ep-aveghkfaexa3e4bx.b02.azurefd.net//wp-content/uploads/2025/01/a-screenshot-of-a-computer-description-automatica-8.png)  \nGet started today by turning on this public preview feature, go to **File** > **Options and settings** > **Options** **> Preview features** and check the box next to **TMDL View**.  \nTo learn more about TMDL View refer to our[documentation](https://aka.ms/tmdlview).",
