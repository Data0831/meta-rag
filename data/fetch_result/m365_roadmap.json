It brings AI observability, enhanced posture reporting, and intelligent Security Copilot agents to automate tasks like triage and policy management. Plus, Purview now extends coverage beyond Microsoft data with third-party signals from partners like BigID, Cyera, OneTrust, and Varonis, giving security teams a single, streamlined view of sensitive data across clouds and platforms. Together, these innovations make DSPM the central hub for managing data security posture in the era of AI.

If the meeting organizer deletes the transcript from Stream, only the copy in OneDrive for Business will be deleted. We also update the default permissions so that meeting organizer and co-organizers will have permission to download or delete the transcript file, while meeting participants can only view the transcript in Teams app or Stream. In addition, the recording/transcript file owner will be able to select in Stream which participants are restricted from downloading, viewing, and editing the transcript. At the same time, meeting transcripts will stop saving in Exchange Online altogether and all transcript storage will be standardized on OneDrive for Business.

All other triggers will be limited to 5,000 per day per trigger.

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages.\nAdditionally, for Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. \nOther changes coming through are:\n- Change in Export limits and ZIP folder partitioning\n- Better Export settings with more options\n- New reporting capabilities\n- Enhancements in Results load file\nStatus: Launched\nRollout start: March CY2025\nCloud instances: GCC, GCC High, DoD\nRelease phases: General Availability\nProducts: Microsoft Purview compliance portal\nPlatforms: Web",

The maximum hold limits for a standard case remain the same as earlier: 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites.

When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.\nStatus: Launched\nRollout start: March CY2025\nCloud instances: Worldwide (Standard Multi-Tenant)\nRelease phases: General Availability\nProducts: Microsoft Teams\nPlatforms: Android",

Previously, these settings were turned off by default in the host global policy. With this update, recording and transcription will be enabled by default in the global calling policy for new tenants and existing tenants who have not modified the host global policy. This change will not impact existing custom policies or modified global policies. After this rollout, recording and transcription services will be more accessible to users, allowing them to turn on and use recording and transcription as needed during Teams calls. Neither recording nor transcription will be automatically enabled in Teams calls.

        "content": "Sections with Copilot is a new SharePoint authoring tool that allows users to create full-fidelity SharePoint sections with just a prompt. It works by first looking at the context of your page to offer prompt suggestions for what content you need next to offer a starting point. Next, you either select one of those starting points or write your own and optionally ground in a relevant file.\n \nOnce you click generate, Sections with Copilot then leverages the knowledge and content already inside of your organization and on your page to create rich sections that go beyond just image and text. This could mean meeting transcripts, recent documents, or any other knowledge Copilot has access to, added to an existing page with a click of a button. \n \nIf the output section isn't quite right, you can then use AI refinement to make changes to both the content and layout of your section, without ever touching our traditional authoring tools. Some examples include \"change the background image\", \"add John Smith's contact information\", or \"make the text more professional\". You can also get different suggestions by clicking \"regenerate\" and then choosing your favorite one to refine further. With Sections with Copilot, you can create content faster than ever before, no matter your SharePoint skill level.\nStatus: Launched\nRollout start: September CY2025\nCloud instances: Worldwide (Standard Multi-Tenant)\nRelease phases: General Availability\nProducts: SharePoint\nPlatforms: Web",

Faster Access: Access event details (e.g. Impacted assets) with just 1 click on the main alerts page itself, compared to 4 clicks earlier, reducing triage time significantly. 3. Enhanced Context: We've added 4 new columns - Location, DLP Rule name, DLP Policy name, Rule Action to display key alert and event attributes upfront — giving you more visibility at a glance. 4. Performance Boost: Cache improvements to ensure faster load times and a smoother experience.
