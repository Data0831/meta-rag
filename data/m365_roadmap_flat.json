When a data security admin identifies a risky user who needs deeper investigation, they can launch a pre-scoped investigation directly from an IRM case, allowing them to view content analysis related to that user and better assess post-incident data impact. Microsoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.\n",

Faster Access: Access event details (e.g. Impacted assets) with just 1 click on the main alerts page itself, compared to 4 clicks earlier, reducing triage time significantly. 3. Enhanced Context: We've added 4 new columns - Location, DLP Rule name, DLP Policy name, Rule Action to display key alert and event attributes upfront — giving you more visibility at a glance. 4. Performance Boost: Cache improvements to ensure faster load times and a smoother experience.

Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",

On top of prioritizing critical alerts for analysts to triage first, alert triage agent will provide a summary of findings to help users understand what are the riskiest activities that make this alert critical to review. IRM correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. IRM enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",

This functionality will be available to Teams Premium and Copilot for M365 licensed users. ",

      "This new capability ties together SharePoint Online library permissions with Purview sensitivity labeling and protection. SharePoint Online document library owners can set a label on the library, automatically applying that label to all unprotected and unlabeled Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and PDF files at rest in the target library. This simplifies labeling in bulk across document libraries in an organization. This capability also helps protect files as they egress from the original document library, such as for collaboration purposes or attempted exfiltration. Files downloaded from these libraries are protected at download. Users accessing these files outside of SharePoint Online have their rights evaluated in real time against the online copy of the document. Changes to user permissions on the online copy of the document are reflected on downloaded copy, including full access removal. This provides a more streamlined way to revoke access to documents for individual users, versus revoking access on a per-document basis.",

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages. For Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. Additionally, customers will experience a faster export capability in the new portal driven through enhancements in backend architecture and optimized partition.",

The behavior is now unified across all export jobs - same download experience, some report experience, same error messages.\nAdditionally, for Standard customers, the need to install a clickonce application in their machine and use that tool to download data for exporting in azure storage is history. Now, in the new experience, customers don’t need to install the app anymore and can download directly through browser. \nOther changes coming through are:\n- Change in Export limits and ZIP folder partitioning\n- Better Export settings with more options\n- New reporting capabilities\n- Enhancements in Results load file",

This limit includes the combined total of user mailboxes and the mailboxes associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups.\n\nThe maximum number of sites in a single case hold has been increased from 100 to 2,000. This limit includes the combined total of OneDrive for Business sites, SharePoint sites, and the sites associated with Microsoft 365 Groups, Microsoft Teams, and Viva Engage Groups. \n\nOverall, the maximum allowed locations in a premium case hold policy in a premium case is 4,000 (2,000 each). This is possible through the new user interface in Purview portal and not through the Classic eDiscovery experience. Additionally, this is not currently possible with Graph. The maximum hold limits for a standard case remain the same as earlier: 1,000 mailboxes and 100 sites. All other settings for eDiscovery hold continue as is. \n\nLastly, in case of license downgrade, the system won't remove any existing holds and won't allow adding more, such as for a policy with a higher number of locations in it (e.g. 1500 Mailbox and 1500 Sites), and if the case setting is downgraded to E3, you will not be able to add more locations in it based on E3 limits, but you will be able to remove locations from it.",

When a Bluetooth headset is connected to the Walkie Talkie app, the SCO setting controls whether the microphone remains constantly connected or disconnects after a period of inactivity. This helps in reducing battery drain by allowing the headset to disconnect when not in use and reconnect when needed.  The user control feature allows users to set a timeout period after which the Bluetooth headset will automatically disconnect if there is no activity. While the SCO setting is turned on, users may experience a slight delay in transmission as the headset reconnects. However, once the headset is reconnected, users will hear a sound indicating that they can start transmitting on the app. This brief delay is a small trade-off for the substantial battery savings on older Bluetooth headsets.",

      "In this update, we are making the below enhancements to Insider Risk Management (IRM) exclusions to reduce alert noise.\n1. Keyword logic update for email - An email will be excluded from scoring only when all the attachments match the keyword exclusions or email subject matches the keyword exclusions. This will be helpful to reduce the email signature noise which commonly contains keyword \"image\".\n2. Keyword exclusions on both target and source file paths - For signals like file copied to removable media, keyword exclusions apply on both target and source file paths.\n3. File path exclusions for removable media - We will start supporting file path exclusions for removable media.\n4. Exclusion support for browser - Domain exclusions are now supported for browsing indicators.\n\nMicrosoft Purview Insider Risk Management correlates various signals to identify potential malicious or inadvertent insider risks, such as IP theft, data leakage, and security violations. Insider Risk Management enables customers to create policies based on their own internal policies, governance, and organizational requirements. Built with privacy by design, users are pseudonymized by default, and role-based access controls and audit logs are in place to help ensure user-level privacy.",

With this update, recording and transcription will be enabled by default in the global calling policy for new tenants and existing tenants who have not modified the host global policy. This change will not impact existing custom policies or modified global policies. After this rollout, recording and transcription services will be more accessible to users, allowing them to turn on and use recording and transcription as needed during Teams calls. Neither recording nor transcription will be automatically enabled in Teams calls. This update is designed to broaden access to AI-powered features like Calls Recap and Calling Copilot, enhancing the overall calling experience.

Here’s what’s new: 1. Smarter prompt tuning We’ve fine-tuned how drafts and rewrites are handled, resulting in clearer, better-formatted output that aligns with your tone and goals. 2. Create content from files and meetings You can now use Word and Excel files, or even meeting recordings, as inputs to help generate content. Whether you're working from a doc, a spreadsheet, or a conversation, Copilot in Amplify helps you turn ideas into polished messaging. 3. Unified content generation flow We’ve migrated to a common service that brings a consistent and scalable experience across all your AI tools in SharePoint and Viva Amplify.

Next, you either select one of those starting points or write your own and optionally ground in a relevant file.\n \nOnce you click generate, Sections with Copilot then leverages the knowledge and content already inside of your organization and on your page to create rich sections that go beyond just image and text. This could mean meeting transcripts, recent documents, or any other knowledge Copilot has access to, added to an existing page with a click of a button. \n \nIf the output section isn't quite right, you can then use AI refinement to make changes to both the content and layout of your section, without ever touching our traditional authoring tools. Some examples include \"change the background image\", \"add John Smith's contact information\", or \"make the text more professional\". You can also get different suggestions by clicking \"regenerate\" and then choosing your favorite one to refine further. With Sections with Copilot, you can create content faster than ever before, no matter your SharePoint skill level. ",

Faster Access: Access event details (e.g. Impacted assets) with just 1 click on the main alerts page itself, compared to 4 clicks earlier, reducing triage time significantly. 3. Enhanced Context: We've added 4 new columns - Location, DLP Rule name, DLP Policy name, Rule Action to display key alert and event attributes upfront — giving you more visibility at a glance. 4. Performance Boost: Cache improvements to ensure faster load times and a smoother experience.

      "To help organizations manage metered consumption costs for SharePoint Agents and Copilot Tuning, we are introducing support for Capacity Packs in the Microsoft 365 Admin Center (MAC). This feature allows global administrators to use prepaid message subscriptions before incurring pay-as-you-go (PAYG) charges. Each Capacity Pack provides 25,000 Copilot messages per month, which can be allocated to Copilot Chat environments via the Power Platform Admin Center (PPAC). Once enabled, MAC will prioritize consumption from these prepaid packs and automatically switch to PAYG when the pack is exhausted. Admins can monitor usage in PPAC, including: • Total messages consumed • Remaining prepaid capacity • Message allocation per environment Key Benefits: • Streamlined billing setup in MAC • Reduced risk of overage charges • Automated environment provisioning for Copilot Chat • Improved cost visibility and governance",
